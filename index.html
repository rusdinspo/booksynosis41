Distilled into 1001 mini-essays arranged thematically, this unique book moves steadily from the basics through to the most advanced areas of math, making it the ideal guide for both the beginner and the math wiz. </p> <p>The book covers all of the fundamental mathematical disciplines: </p> <ul><li>Geometry <br> </li><li>Numbers <br> </li><li>Analysis <br> </li><li>Logic <br> </li><li>Algebra <br> </li><li>Probability and statistics <br> </li><li>Applied mathematics <br> </li><li>Discrete mathematics <br> </li><li>Games and recreational mathematics <br> </li><li>Philosophy and metamathematics </li></ul> <p>Expert mathematician Richard Elwes explains difficult concepts in the simplest language with a minimum of jargon. Along the way he reveals such mathematical magic as how to count to 1023 using just 10 fingers and how to make an unbreakable code. </p> <p>Enlightening and entertaining, <b><i>Mathematics 1001</i></b> makes the language of math come alive.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Richard Elwes is a writer, lecturer and researcher in mathematics. He contributes to <i>New Scientist</i> and <i>Plus Magazine</i> and has published numerous scholarly research papers. </p>Designed with the general reader and students in mind, this volume provides clear and concise explanations of mathematical concepts. It uses the simplest, jargon-free language possible to clarify such concepts as probability and statistics, discrete mathematics, logic, and analysis. Covering 1001 mathematical topics, the work covers such subjects as geometry, algebra, numbers, applied mathematics, and calculus. This is a fun resource that can make most any student find something interesting in mathematics. It is a concise, general work that can be used for browsing or for looking up specific topics in both high school and public libraries. (Melinda F. Matthews <i>American Reference Books Annual 2010</i> 2011-03-01)<br><br>Often, when one hears a scientific or mathematical reference, it usually requires a concise explanation using regular terminology. Elwes (mathematics researcher, Univ. of Leeds, England) gives us a shortcut to some of mathematics' most significant topics, doing for his subject what Paul Parsons did for science in Science 101: Absolutely Everything That Matters About Science in 1001 Bite-Sized Explanations. As in that book, concise essays about a variety of mathematical fields--numbers, algebra, geometry, logic--are arranged here by broad topics along with more specific subjects. The accessible text is written without troublesome jargon and terminology. Many of the essays contain illustrations of plots, graphs, and figures. The index makes it easy to find an essay if one is not particularly familiar with the hierarchy of mathematics. One can rarely call a mathematics book fun, but that's exactly what Elwes's book is. Appropriate for school, public, and academic collections. (Margaret Dominy <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Absolutely fascinating.... Dr. Elwes is brilliant at giving the reader the broad perspective, with enough details to fascinate, rather than confuse. Many of the topics cover the foundations of an area of mathematics, and others cover unsolved problems, and everything in between.... I highly recommend this book for any student considering math as their future field of study, as well as anyone who ever enjoyed studying math. For that matter, this book would also be good for anyone who finds math at all intriguing.

Containing many of the writings of the Gnostics since the time of Christ, this was the work that launched modern Gnostic studies and exposed a movement whose teachings are in may ways as relevant today as they were sixteen centuries ago. Although some of the texts had appeared in other translations, the 1978 edition was the first and only translation of these ancient and fascinating manuscripts to appear in one volume.<br>This new edition is the result of ten years of additional research, and editorial and critical work. Every translation has been changed or added to; many have been thoroughly revised.<br>Unearthed in 1945 near the town of Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt, the texts literally begin where the Dead Sea Scrolls end. Their discovery is seen as equally significant, bringing to light a long-hidden well of new information, sources, and insights into early Judaism and the roots of Christianity.<br>Each text is accompanied by a new and expanded introduction. Also included are a revised general introduction and an afterword discussing the modern relevance of Gnosticism, from Voltaire and Blake through Melville and Yeats to Jack Kerouac and science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.<br>The translations and introductions to the Nag Hammadi texts are by members of the Coptic Gnostic Library Project, which includes such scholars as Helmut Koester, George McRae, and Elaine Pagels.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek'<i>This definitive translation has become a standard since its first publication in 1977.</i>'<br>J.K.

UP.</p><p><i>Battleground Berlin</i> is the product of an unprecedented collaboration between two veteran intelligence officers--one with the CIA, the other with the KGB--who worked on opposite sides in postwar Berlin. With the help of journalist George Bailey, they have told what will likely stand as the definitive account of those remarkable years. The KGB had the advantage of existing, in one form or another, since the Russian Revolution, while the CIA was a fledgling agency. But KGB agents and analysts were under chronic pressure to twist their intelligence reports for political reasons, which evened the scales somewhat. <p> Armed with information from numerous interviews, access to previously secret documents (many reproduced in the book), extensive research, and their own recollections, the authors roam the existing Cold War literature, correcting lies and false conclusions, putting rumors to rest, and exposing ignorance--in short, setting the record straight. They provide definitive accounts of many key episodes, including the double defection of Otto John, the head of West German counterespionage, and the famous tunnel incident of 1955-56, in which an American tunnel into the Soviet sector was exposed by a highly placed informant and then "discovered" in an elaborate ploy to protect the agent. <i>Battleground Berlin</i> is a remarkable amalgam. It is a fascinating, sometimes gripping spy story, complete with safe houses, forged identities, double agents, and street-corner rendezvous; it is also a scrupulously researched piece of historical scholarship and analysis.</p>A troika of erstwhile adversaries team up to deliver an absorbing and authoritative inside view of how American and Soviet- bloc intelligence agencies plied their offbeat trade in divided Berlin during the first 15 years of the Cold War. Drawing on newly available archival material and their own experiences, Murphy (a sometime chief of the CIA's Berlin station), Kondrashev (who headed the KGB's German Section), and Bailey (a former director of Radio Liberty) offer an essentially chronological account of who was spying on whom in Berlin and to what avail, from V-E Day through the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Before getting down to business, however, they provide brief rundowns on the major services, including the fledgling CIA, the thoroughly professional KGB, and East Germany's Stasi. Having set the scene, the authors recount the facts behind convulsive events that produced headlines throughout the world. Cases in point range from the 1953 uprisings in the German Democratic Republic, the tunnel the CIA dug to eavesdrop on supposedly secure phone conversations originating in the Eastern Sector, the cover- organization games played by both sides, counterintelligence as well as disinformation efforts and propaganda campaigns (e.g., Nikita Khrushchev's threat to sign a separate peace agreement with the GDR), and, of course, the Wall. Covered as well are the stories of high-profile defectors (Pyotr Popov, Otto John, et al.), interservice rivalries (notably, between the KGB and the Stasi). Both Moscow and Washington, the authors point out, ignored some crucial, first-rate intelligence gathered by their operatives in the field. Eye-opening detail on cloak-and-dagger operations in a conquered capital city that once threatened to alter the balance of world power and breach the world's hard-won peace.

It was in France and Belgium, the cradles of literary Symbolism, that Symbolist painting was born. It plunged headlong into the cultural space opened up by the poetry of Baudelaire and Mallarme and by the operas of Wagner. Symbolist painters sought not to represent appearances but to express &#34;the Idea,&#34; and the imaginary therefore plays an important part in their work. &#34;Dream&#34; was their credo; they execrated, with a fanatical hatred, impressionism, realism, naturalism, and the scientistic. The main principle of Symbolism, that of &#34;correspondences,&#34; was to attain harmony between all the different arts, or even to realise the total work of art (Gesamtkunstwerk) that Wagner had dreamt of creating. What we rediscover today, after a period of neglect, is this: Symbolist painting is essential to our understanding of modern art, not only because it spread across the world like wildfir</p><p>Gilles Neret was an art historian, journalist, writer, and museum correspondent.

It all began with a photo of a river choked with the bodies of hundreds of Chinese civilians that shook Iris to her core. Who were these people? Why had this happened and how could their story have been lost to history? She could not shake that image from her head. She could not forget what she had seen. <br><br> A few short years later, Chang revealed this "second Holocaust" to the world. The Japanese atrocities against the people of Nanking were so extreme that a Nazi party leader based in China actually petitioned Hitler to ask the Japanese government to stop the massacre. But who was this woman that single-handedly swept away years of silence, secrecy and shame? <br><br> Her mother, Ying-Ying, provides an enlightened and nuanced look at her daughter, from Iris' home-made childhood newspaper, to her early years as a journalist and later, as a promising young historian, her struggles with her son's autism and her tragic suicide. <i>The Woman Who Could Not Forget</i> cements Iris' legacy as one of the most extraordinary minds of her generation and reveals the depth and beauty of the bond between a mother and daughter.<br><i><br>The Woman Who Could Not Forget</i> won 2012 Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association (APALA) Awards for Literature in Adult Non-Fiction category.</p><p><b>Ying-Ying Chang</b> is the mother of Iris Chang.

Matters of definition, classification, and logical structure deserve (and receive here) careful attention for the first time in the mathematical experience of many of the readers. While it is neither feasible nor desirable to include proofs of the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems along the way in an elementary course, readers need to see precise and clear-cut statements of these theorems, and understand their role in the subject. Appropriate existence and uniqueness proofs in the Appendix are included, and referred to where appropriate in the main body of the text. Applications are highlighted throughout the text. These include: What explains the commonly observed lag time between indoor and outdoor daily temperature oscillations?; What makes the difference between doomsday and extinction in alligator populations?; How do a unicycle and a two-axle car react differently to road bumps?; Why are flagpoles hollow instead of solid?; Why might an earthquake demolish one building and leave standing the one next door?; How can you predict the time of next perihelion passage of a newly observed comet?; Why and when does non-linearity lead to chaos in biological and mechanical systems?; What explains the difference in the sounds of a guitar, a xylophone, and a drum? Includes almost 300 computer-generated graphics throughout the text. This text, with enough material for 2 terms, provides a concrete and readable text for the traditional course in elementary differential equations that science, engineering, and mathematics readers take following calculus.</p><p>Focused on the standard elementary techniques of solution of differential equations and the mathematical modeling of real-world situations, this book anticipates and addresses the questions and difficulties typically encountered by those studying the subject for the first time.C. Henry Edwards is emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Tennessee in 1960, and recently retired after 40 years of classroom teaching (including calculus or differential equations almost every term) at the universities of Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Georgia, with a brief interlude at the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) as an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow. He has received numerous teaching awards, including the University of Georgia&#39;s honoratus medal in 1983 (for sustained excellence in honors teaching), its Josiah Meigs award in 1991 (the institution&#39;s highest award for teaching), and the 1997 statewide Georgia Regents award for research university faculty teaching excellence. His scholarly career has ranged from research and dissertation direction in topology to the history of mathematics to computing and technology in the teaching and applications of mathematics. In addition to being author or co-author of calculus, advanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations textbooks, he is well-known to calculus instructors as author of The Historical Development of the Calculus (Springer-Verlag, 1979). During the 1990s he served as a principal investigator on three NSF-supported projects: (1) A school mathematics project including Maple for beginning algebra students, (2) A Calculus-with-Mathematica program, and (3) A MATLAB-based computer lab project for numerical analysis and differential equations students. David E. Penney, University of Georgia, completed his Ph.D. at Tulane University in 1965 (under the direction of Prof. L. Bruce Treybig) while teaching at the University of New Orleans. Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran&#39;s Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee&#39;s research team&#39;s primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney&#39;s primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium. During his tenure at the University of Georgia he received numerous University-wide teaching awards as well as directing several doctoral dissertations and seven undergraduate research projects. He is the author of research papers in number theory and topology and is the author or co-author of textbooks on calculus, computer programming, differential equations, linear algebra, and liberal arts mathematics.</p><h2>Latin America: Conflict and Creation, a Historical Reader</h2><p><p>This text reproduces documents that provide a better understanding of the Latin American past and present, and draws most heavily from Latin American sources. It is distinguished by the widest variety of documentation, including art work, short stories, poetry, folk tales and travel accounts. For sociologists, historians, and all those interested in Latin American studies and history. </p></p><p>Fostering a better understanding of Latin America within an historical context, this fascinating collection of readings is based on the central theme and powerful drama of the two conflicting trends contributing to the nation-building in Latin American; these being the imposition of first European and then U.S. institutions from the 16th century onward and the local efforts to alter them. Within that theme, the book follows a three-goal course of study: 1) to reproduce documents that provide a better understanding of the Latin American past and present; 2) to introduce a wide variety of documentation (art work, short stories, poetry folk tales, and more); and 3) to draw heavily from Latin American sources.</p><h2>Canon EOS Rebel T3i / 600D: From Snapshots to Great Shots</h2><p>Now that you've bought the amazing Canon EOS Rebel T3i/600D, you need a book that goes beyond a tour of the camera's features to show you exactly how to use the Rebel to take great pictures.

The authors aim to present corporate finance as the working of a small number of integrated and powerful intuitions, rather than a collection of unrelated topics. They develop the central concepts of modern finance: arbitrage, net present value, efficient markets, agency theory, options, and the trade-off between risk and return, and use them to explain corporate finance with a balance of theory and application. The well-respected author team is known for their clear, accessible presentation of material that makes this text an excellent teaching tool. The ninth edition has been fully updated to reflect the recent financial crisis and is now accompanied by Connect, an exciting new homework management system.</p><p>Stephen Ross is presently the Franco Modigliani Professor of Finance and Economics at the Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One of the most widely published authors in finance and economics, Professor Ross is recognized for his work in developing the Arbitrage Pricing Theory and his substantial contributions to the discipline through his research in signaling, agency theory, option pricing, and the theory of the term structure of interest rates, among other topics.

Drawing on the evidence of public art, especially sculpture, and painting, poetry, and classical mythology, she ranges over the allegorical presence of the woman in the Western tradition with a sharply observant eye and a piquant and engaging style.</p><p>Among <b>Marina Warner</b>'s books are <i>From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales and Their Tellers</i> (1995), <i>Alone of All Her Sex: The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary</i> (1983), and <i>Joan of Arc</i> (California, 1999).Examining an impressive scope of materialart (Donatello, Vermeer, Judy Chicago), Greek mythology, the Bible, literature, linguistics and mass mediaWarner (Alone of All Her Sex) traces the different meanings which have been ascribed to the female form throughout the ages. "Liberty is not represented by a woman because women were and are free"; allegory by definition requires a gap (and a resemblance) between the ideal and the real. But there is a give-and-take of meaning between the female fantasy figuresAthena, Wisdom, Temperance, et al.and actual women. Warner suggests that some women (the armed maidens of Justice and Chastity, etc.) may take on male personas (the brandished weapons) to best shield themselves from the masculine code. Pandora, the first woman of classical myth, and Eve, the mother in the Judeo-Christian story, bear the burden of men's dreams: made and named by others, agents of calamity through the desire they inspire but do not experience themselves. Unlike men, women lose their individuality as they become universal symbols, and the only way to rid the female form of contaminated meanings is "to respect the individual inside the symbol"to look through the Statue of Liberty's eyes to see that she can represent freedom only if we were to forget the female condition. The difficulty with this sometimes brilliant study is that, like the history it examines, it never comes to rest with an unchanging definition. Illustrated.

You can! Making Room for Life reveals how to make all of these things a reality. Not by working faster or having more gadgets, but by simply choosing a lifestyle of conversation and community over a lifestyle of accumulation. Randy Frazee&#39;s practical, motivating insights call you back to the kind of relationships and life rhythms you were created to enjoy. In Making Room for Life, Frazee shows you how---and why it&#39;s so important---to balance work and play, establish healthy boundaries, deal with children&#39;s activities and homework, bring Jesus to your neighbors, and build authentic bonds with a circle of close friends. Share these insights with those around you and help usher in an amazing transformation: your life and the lives of others blooming, in the midst of the chaos and fragmentation of today&#39;s culture, into communities of purpose and peace.</p><p>This superb workbook has an enormous audience: Christians whose lifestyles have gotten too hectic and over-scheduled. The American plague of busy-ness has caused epidemic fatigue and spiritual discontent--crippling the love and connection within many households, according to Randy Frazee, a senior pastor of Pantego Bible Church in Fort Worth, Texas and author of <i>The Connecting Church</i>. Frazee is a warm, self-revealing, and sensible narrator--like a Christian Dr. Phil, counseling readers on how to get their priorities straight. He talks about our ridiculously over-reaching lifestyles (admitting his own tendencies) and suggests calling day planners "24/7 planners" or "Chaos Planners." He asks readers to consider organizing their days into a "Hebrew Day Planner"--meaning following God's design of integrating a day of rest into the week. "If we violate this design, we are abusing our bodies and souls, and little by little we diminish our effectiveness," he writes. <p> Frazee is adamant when it comes to re-shaping the family lifestyle. For instance, he confronts parental over-achieving and workaholic tendencies with a loving vengeance. According to Frazee, "Dragging our children away from home in the late afternoon and evening hours to transport them to adult-driven, highly structured, age-graded activities" can result in many losses for children--including less creative play, less chances to for leadership or mentoring, a strain on health (too much fast foods and too little rest), and the loss of the family meal. He devotes numerous pages to the "slow food movement"--offering suggestions for reclaiming the family meal with easy family recipes, setting the table, saying grace, and cultivating dinner conversation. Like a good workbook--Frazee includes an interactive section at the end of each chapter for jotting down thoughts and noting "personal action steps" as well as suggestions for leading a small group discussion. Devout Christian or not--this is an excellent basic book for many frantic households. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p>Randy Frazee is the senior minister of Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he teaches and leads in partnership with pastor and author Max Lucado.

A novel mingling mysticism, madness, sadistic cruelty and nascent sexuality, it gives a scathing insight into the effects of forced vocations and the unnatural life of the convent. A <em>succï¿½s de scandale</em> at the end of the eighteenth century, it has attracted and unsettled readers ever since. For Diderot's novel is not simply a story of a young girl with a bad habit; it is also a powerfully emblematic fable about oppression and intolerance.<br><br>This new translation includes Diderot's all-important prefatory material, which he placed, disconcertingly, at the end of the novel, and which turns what otherwise seems like an exercise in realism into what is now regarded as a masterpiece of proto-modernist fiction.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

How does professional baseball evaluate hitters? Is a singles hitter like Wade Boggs more valuable than a power hitter like David Ortiz? Should NFL teams pass or run more often on first downs? Could professional basketball have used statistics to expose the crooked referee Tim Donaghy? Does money buy performance in professional sports?</p><br><p> In <i>Mathletics</i>, Wayne Winston describes the mathematical methods that top coaches and managers use to evaluate players and improve team performance, and gives math enthusiasts the practical tools they need to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of their favorite sports--and maybe even gain the outside edge to winning bets. <i>Mathletics</i> blends fun math problems with sports stories of actual games, teams, and players, along with personal anecdotes from Winston's work as a sports consultant. Winston uses easy-to-read tables and illustrations to illuminate the techniques and ideas he presents, and all the necessary math concepts--such as arithmetic, basic statistics and probability, and Monte Carlo simulations--are fully explained in the examples.</p><br><p> After reading <i>Mathletics</i>, you will understand why baseball teams should almost never bunt, why football overtime systems are unfair, why points, rebounds, and assists aren't enough to determine who's the NBA's best player--and much, much more. In a new epilogue, Winston discusses the stats and numerical analysis behind some recent sporting events, such as how the Dallas Mavericks used analytics to become the 2011 NBA champions.</p></p><p><p>"Winston has an uncanny knack for bringing the game alive through the fascinating mathematical questions he explores.

The novel breaks new ground in exploring the relation between the individual and power, asking why the villagers so readily submit to an authority which may exist only in their collective imagination. Published only after Kafka's death, <em>The Castle</em> appeared in the same decade as modernist masterpieces by Eliot, Joyce, Woolf, Mann and Proust, and is among the central works of modern literature. This new translation by prize-winning translator Anthea Bell follows the German text established by critical scholarship, and mentions manuscript variants in the notes. The detailed introduction by Ritchie Robertson, a leading Kafka scholar, explores the many meanings of this famously enigmatic novel, providing guidance without reducing the reader's freedom to make sense of this fascinating novel. In addition, the edition includes a Biographical Preface which places Kafka within the context of his time, plus an up-to-date bibliography and chronology of Kafka's life.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Thankfully, Max Brod did not honor his friend Franz Kafka's final wishes. Instead, he did everything within his power to ensure that Kafka's work would find publication--including making some sweeping changes in the original texts. Until recently, the world has known only Brod's version of Kafka, with its altered punctuation, word order, and chapter divisions. Restoring much of what had previously been expunged, as well as the fluid, oral quality of Kafka's original German, Mark Harman's new translation of <i>The Castle</i> is a major literary event. <p> One of three unfinished novels left after Kafka's death, <i>The Castle</i> is in many ways the writer's most enduring and influential work. In Harman's muscular translation, Kafka's text seems more modern than ever, the words tumbling over one another, the sentences separated only by commas. Harman's version also ends the same way as Kafka's original manuscript--that is, in mid-sentence: "She held out her trembling hand to K. and had him sit down beside her, she spoke with great difficulty, it was difficult to understand her, but what she said--." For anyone used to reading Kafka in his artificially complete form, the effect is extraordinary; it is as if Kafka himself had just stepped from the room, leaving behind him a work whose resolution is the more haunting for being forever out of reach.</p>"The new Schocken edition of <i>The Castle</i> represents a major and long-awaited event in English-language publishing. It is a wonderful piece of news for all Kafka readers who, for more than half a century, have had to rely on flawed, superannuated editions. Mark Harman is to be commended for his success in capturing the fresh, fluid, almost breathless style of Kafka's original manuscript, which leaves the reader hanging in mid-sentence." <br>--Mark M. Anderson, Columbia University <p><i>"The Castle,</i> published here for the first time in 1930, was the first Kafka to arrive in America. After the war, Hannah Arendt remarked that The Castle might finally be comprehensible to the generation of the forties, who had had the occasion to watch their world become Kafkaesque. What will the generation of the nineties make of <i>The Castle,</i> now that its full message has arrived? Here is the masterpiece behind the masterpiece."<br>--Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, Haverford College</p> <p>"Sparkles with comedy, with zest, and with a fresh visual power, which in the Muir translation were indistinct or lost. This is not just a new, brilliantly insightful, sensitive, and stylish translation, it is a new <i>Castle,</i> and it is a pleasure to read."<br>--Christopher Middleton, University of Texas at Austin</p> <p>"This is the closest to Kafka's original novel and intention that any translation could get, and what is more, it is eminently readable.

His approach revolves around many of the core competencies of the EPAS accreditation (CSWE, 2008). Most of the core competencies are addressed with an emphasis on professional identity, ethical practice, critical thinking, diversity, practice contexts, and, a major practice framework of the book, the practice stages of engagement, assessment, intervention, and evaluation.</p></p><p><p>James (Jim) Dudley has been involved in spirituality activities and their role in social work practice for many years. Besides teaching numerous Spirituality and Social Work courses at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, he has also conducted research and published on the topic, as well as led several retreats and workshops. He has a Master&#x2019;s Degree in Spirituality Studies and has completed training in spiritual direction. He also has an MSW Degree and Ph.D. in Social Work and is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in North Carolina.</p><p>Dr. Jim Dudley&#x2019;s <i>Spirituality Matters in Social Work</i> is a welcome addition to the growing number of books and articles in the social work literature focused on preparing social workers to effectively engage spiritual and religious issues in the helping process when they are important to helping their clients. Dr. Dudley&#x2019;s book explores, in depth, key elements of ethical, spiritually-sensitive social work approaches and strategies in terms of engagement, spiritual assessment, interventions and evaluation. More than most, his book pays attention to the integration of spirituality and religion at micro, mezzo, <i>and</i> macro levels of intervention, as well as the important question of how to determine the effectiveness and impact of spiritually-sensitive programs and practice on the clients it serves.</p> <p>--Rick Chamiec-Case, North American Association of Christians in Social Work</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a compelling need for clinical guidance concerning the complex issues of spirituality and religion in social work practice.

It is both wise and wonderful.</p> <p></p> <p>&#x2013;Holly Nelson-Becker, Loyola University Chicago</p> <p>Fantastic... Dudley not only educates social workers on the integration of clients&#x2019; religion and spirituality, but also creates opportunities for the reader to explore his/her personal spiritual beliefs as they relate to practice. This balance of providing content with practicing self-awareness is critical in any helping profession. This book includes practical methods for learning about others&#x2019; religious beliefs, maintaining a spiritually-sensitive approach to practice, and identifying assessment tools and spiritual interventions at both the micro and macro levels. I highly recommend this text for both students and practitioners in social work and related helping professions.</p> <p>--Holly Oxhandler, Baylor University</p> <p>For far too long, spirituality was neglected in social work and yet it may be a major source of strength for the clients that our students will serve. The focus on spirituality and multiple levels of practice can help students understand the place of spirituality in all levels of practice. I believe this text will benefit both BSW and MSSW students including those who consider themselves to be spiritual and those who do not.</p> <p>--Melody Loya, West Texas A&amp;M University</p></p><h2>Value Investing Made Easy</h2><p>For more than 60 years, savvy stock market pros have practiced the principles of value investing.

In this groundbreaking new book, O'Keefe gives a comprehensive overview of the stunning side-by-side growing areas of these two world-class wines that are separated only by the city of Alba and profiles a number of the fiercely individualistic winemakers who create structured yet elegant and complex wines of remarkable depth from Italy's most noble grape, Nebbiolo.<br><br> A masterful narrator of the aristocratic origins of winemaking in this region, O'Keefe gives readers a clear picture of why Barolo is called both the King of Wines and the Wine of Kings. Profiles of key Barolo and Barbaresco villages include fascinating stories of the families, wine producers, and idiosyncratic personalities that have shaped the area and its wines and helped ignite the Quality Wine Revolution that eventually swept through all of Italy.<br><br> The book also considers practical factors impacting viticulture and enology in the Langhe region, including climate change, destructive use of harsh chemicals in the vineyards versus the gentler treatments used for centuries, the various schools of thought regarding vinification and aging, and expansion and zoning of vineyard areas.

In the first book to examine how the movies constructed images of African American religion, Judith Weisenfeld explores these cinematic representations and how they reflected and contributed to complicated discourses about race, the social and moral requirements of American citizenship, and the very nature of American identity. <br><br>Drawing on such textual sources as studio production files, censorship records, and discussions and debates about religion and film in the black press, as well as providing close readings of films, this richly illustrated and meticulously researched book brings religious studies and film history together in innovative ways.</p><p>"This is a ground-breaking book. The text is remarkable in its use of MPAA files and studio archives; Weisenfeld uncovers all sorts of side stories that enrich the larger narrative. The writing is clear and concise, and Weisenfeld makes important theoretical interpretations without indulging in difficult jargon.

There was nothing before. There&#x2019;s been nothing as good since.&#x201d; Critical opinion of this book hasn&#x2019;t dimmed since Hemingway uttered these words; as author Russell Banks says in these pages, Twain &#x201c;makes possible an American literature which would otherwise not have been possible.&#x201d; He was the most famous American of his day, and remains in ours the most universally revered American writer. Here the master storytellers Geoffrey Ward, Ken Burns, and Dayton Duncan give us the first fully illustrated biography of Mark Twain, American literature&#x2019;s touchstone, its funniest and most inventive figure.<br><br>This book pulls together material from a variety of published and unpublished sources. It examines not merely his justly famous novels, stories, travelogues, and lectures, but also his diaries, letters, and 275 illustrations and photographs from throughout his life. The authors take us from Samuel Langhorne Clemens&#x2019;s boyhood in Hannibal, Missouri, to his time as a riverboat worker&#x2014;when he adopted the sobriquet &#x201c;Mark Twain&#x201d;&#x2014;to his varied careers as a newspaperman, printer, and author. They follow him from the home he built in Hartford, Connecticut, to his peripatetic travels across Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. We see Twain grieve over his favorite daughter&#x2019;s death, and we see him writing and noticing everything.<br><br>Twain believed that &#x201c;The secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.&#x201d; This paradox fueled his hilarity and lay at the core of this irreverent yet profoundly serious author. With essays by Russell Banks, Jocelyn Chadwick, Ron Powers, and John Boyer, as well as an interview with actor and <br>frequent Twain portrayer Hal Holbrook, this book provides a full and rich portrayal of the first figure of American letters.</p><p>This is more than a lavishly illustrated companion book to the Mark Twain PBS series. National Book Critics Circle Award winner Geoffrey C. Ward, Dayton Duncan, and Ken Burns have produced a cogent, colorful portrait of the man who forged our national identity in the sentences he spun. Excellent though the brisk narrative may be, the book's greatest pleasures are the extensive Twain quotations; no one has topped his description of the Mississippi River, and he had a salty remark for every occasion (charged an outrageous fee for a boat ride on the Sea of Galilee, he cracked, "Do you wonder now that Christ walked?"). Passages from his correspondence reveal a man of deep feeling; letters to his wife Livy movingly express enduring marital love, and the grief-stricken note following his beloved daughter Susy's sudden death is almost unbearable to read. Excerpts from less well known works like "The War Prayer" highlight Twain's scathing contempt for imperialism and hypocrisy alike. Several freestanding pieces by various admirers (including novelist Russell Banks and actor Hal Holbrook) supplement the authors' text; most notable among them is critic Jocelyn Chadwick's persuasive defense of Twain's frequent use of "The Six-Letter Word" (n----r) in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> as a necessary and still-shocking device to confront Americans with the moral horror of racism. Gracefully synthesizing current scholarship, this warmhearted biography provides the perfect introduction to Mark Twain. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>GEOFFREY C.

They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good.</p><p>But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. <i>Perl Best Practices</i> author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects.</p><p>With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging.</p><p>They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, <i>Perl Best Practices</i> offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on howsoftware ought to be created.</p><p>Most of all, <i>Perl Best Practices</i> offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way.</p><p>Praise for <i>Perl Best Practices</i> from Perl community members:</p><p>"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of <i>Perl Best Practices</i> on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide."-- Randal Schwartz</p><p>"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book."-- Peter Scott</p><p>"<i>Perl Best Practices</i> will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of "scripting languages".

With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too."-- Andy Lester</p><p>"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years."-- Bill Odom</p><p>"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams."-- Andrew Sundstrom</p>"<i>Perl Best Practices</i> provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers."-- Bennett Todd"I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer."-- Paul Fenwick"At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues."-- Jacinta Richardson"If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it."-- Steven Lembark"The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book.

Beginning in her grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen in California, Anusasananan travels to her family&#x2019;s home in China, and from there fans out to embrace Hakka cooking across the globe&#x2015;including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada, Peru, and beyond. More than thirty home cooks and chefs share their experiences of the Hakka diaspora as they contribute over 140 recipes for everyday Chinese comfort food as well as more elaborate festive specialties.<br><br>This book likens Hakka cooking to a nomadic type of &#x201c;soul food,&#x201d; or a hearty cooking tradition that responds to a shared history of hardship and oppression. Earthy, honest, and robust, it reflects the diversity of the estimated 75 million Hakka living in China and greater Asia, and in scattered communities around the world&#x2015;yet still retains a core flavor and technique. Anusasananan&#x2019;s deep personal connection to the tradition, together with her extensive experience testing and developing recipes, make this book both an intimate journey of discovery and an exciting introduction to a vibrant cuisine.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Linda Anusasananan has written a remarkable cookbook, weaving together a poignant memoir and an in-depth exploration of Hakka cuisine.

Written in a clear and accessible style, the book explains why it is important to allow young children access to philosophy during primary-school education. Wartenberg also gives advice on how to construct a &#39;learner-centered&#39; classroom, in which children discuss philosophical issues with one another as they respond to open-ended questions by saying whether they agree or disagree with what others have said.</p><p>Thomas E. Wartenberg is professor of philosophy at Mount Holyoke College and has been working with teachers on teaching philosophy for children for over a decade. He is a member of the American Philosophical Association Committee on Precollege Instruction in Philosophy. Among his other books are Existentialism and Thinking on Screen.Oh, to be a child in a literary discussion with Thomas Wartenberg! He understands that young children are deep thinkers trying to figure life out and that great children&#x2019;s books can help them do so. As he makes clear, &#x201c;philosophy&#x201d; is just a fancy grown-up word for an activity kids do naturally, and this teacher-friendly, easy-to-read book with its invaluable guided questions for individual titles will help all of us improve the quality, depth, and liveliness of discussions in the classroom reading corner. (Sam Swope, author of several books, including I Am a Pencil and The Araboolies of Liberty Street)<br><br>Those unfamiliar with philosophy will love the brief introduction to the disciplines of philosophy; philosophers will find the use of children's literature a refreshing starting point. While intended for educators new to pre-college philosophy, this book nicely encapsulates for philosophers one method of doing such work.

An unschooled painter who was a disabled World War I veteran, Pippin is represented in public and private collections across America.<br>I Tell My Heart features over 110 Pippin paintings including many never before reproduced nor shown in public since the artist's lifetime, as well as many black and white archival photographs of Pippin and his contemporaries.<br>Pippin provides a first-hand view of several little-celebrated aspects of African-American culture: documentation of the bravery of black soldiers in combat; the dignity, beauty, and hardships of everyday life among rural people circa 1900; and the strength and warmth of intergenerational familial relationships.<br>The book is divided into five thematic areas - war, genre, academic, biblical, and historical subjects - giving readers the opportunity to discover the breadth of Pippin's visual imagination. A chronology of his life, an exhibition history, a list of all known works, along with a selected bibliography provide the most complete and thorough information about Horace Pippin that has ever been collected.<br>A diverse group of distinguished scholars have freshly considered all aspects of Pippin's life and work. Judith E. Stein constructs a fuller picture of Pippin as an artist and as a man by using his letters and by culling his quoted remarks from period publications. Cornel West explores Pippin's significance vis a vis American and African-American cultural history. Authors Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, Richard J. Powell, and Judith Wilson shed new light on Pippin's iconography - from his images of war to his biblical inspirations. And conservators Mark F. Bockrath and Barbara A. Buckley discuss Pippin's process and technique, a subject never addressed before.<br>I Tell My Heart restores Horace Pippin to his full status as an exemplar of the American spirit. As an early-recognized and nationally celebrated African-American artist, Pippin is an example and an inspiration to all.</p><p>As art history absorbs the lessons of multiculturalism, this book, based on an exhibition, should launch Pippin (1888-1946) into a well-deserved place in the pantheon of modern American painters. Pippin was a self-taught African American artist who scrutinized his world with visual honesty. His paintings have been previously summarized as "primitive" or folk art "naive" in technique and vision; Stein ( Red Grooms , LJ 7/86) and assorted other scholars bring Pippin's work back into its full artistic worth and provide it with social context. The book is beautifully organized, with essays on the artist's life and times, a superb section on technique, and a reference section that includes chronology, exhibition history, a catalogue raisonne of known works, and an index to the paintings. This intellectually crafted and emotionally appealing look at a black artist's experiences is recommended for both public and academic library collections.<br><i>- Paula A.

Drawing on widespread contemporary evidence, Wolffe describes the failures of Henry&#x2019;s long reign from 1422 to 1471, which included the collapse of justice, the loss of the French territories, and the final disintegration of his government. He argues that the posthumous cult of Henry was promoted by Henry VII as a way of excusing his uncle&#x2019;s political failures while enhancing the image of the dynasty.

Analyzing the complex and interrelated impact of gender, race, class, and region on the lives of black and white women, she shows how their diverse experiences and behavior reflected and influenced the changing social order and political economy of the state and region. Her work expands our knowledge of black and white women by studying them outside the plantation setting.<br><br>Bynum searched local and state court records, public documents, and manuscript collections to locate and document the lives of these otherwise ordinary, obscure women. Some appeared in court as abused, sometimes abusive, wives, as victims and sometimes perpetrators of violent assaults, or as participants in ilicit, interracial relationships. During the Civil War, women freqently were cited for theft, trespassing, or rioting, usually in an effort to gain goods made scarce by war. Some women were charged with harboring evaders or deserters of the Confederacy, an act that reflected their conviction that the Confederacy was destroying them.<br><br>These politically powerless unruly women threatened to disrupt the underlying social structure of the Old South, which depended on the services and cooperation of all women. Bynum examines the effects of women's social and sexual behavior on the dominant society and shows the ways in which power flowed between private and public spheres. Whether wives or unmarried, enslaved or free, women were active agents of the society's ordering and dissolution.<br><br></p><p>"Drawing on records of women who appeared in courts in three counties of the North Carolina Piedmont to seek redress against abuse or to answer charges of disorderly behavior, [Bynum] analyzes how courts attempted to enforce ideals of domesticity and how deviant women resisted. . . . A sophisticated but lively account of the lives of a subset of women whose experiences reflect importantly on the nature of southern society."-- <i>Choice</i> <br>Victoria E.

Pain is the most common reason for children to seek a medical consultation and sometimes is the most common reason for avoiding it. Unaddressed fears and anxiety complicate pain management and recovery. This book comprehensively examines children&#39;s fears and anxieties that accompany their need for pain relief, and gives the professional the communication skills and words that can help calm these fears. This book is addressed to all disciplines, and is organized into three parts: Part I explores the scientific understanding of pain as a part of children s development; Part II explores pain treatments themselves, their efficacies and how to combine them for therapeutic impact; and Part III uses this understanding to help translate knowledge into clinical practice in three major arenas of pediatric health care and the general practice setting: the physicians office, the dentist&#39;s office, and in the hospital. Without doubt, this volume will become a standard on pediatric pain management for many years to come.</p><p>Leora Kuttner, PhD is a pediatric clinical psychologist who specializes in children&#39;s pain management.

Think Again&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Know thyself.</i> <br>&#x2014;SOCRATES <br>&nbsp; <br>THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE of advice that can possibly be given to you, the prospective law student, is simple. Surprisingly, perhaps, it has nothing to do with how to study or how to write a good exam. It is not about how to glean wisdom from the dusty pages of the U.S. Supreme Court opinions that shaped our country, or how to make the law review, or how to impress an employer in a job interview. Those things are important, but they&#x2019;re all secondary. <br>The most important advice that you can get as a prospective law student isn&#x2019;t even about law school. It&#x2019;s about you&#x2014;and it can be summed up succinctly but completely with a single word. <br>Commit. <br>That&#x2019;s it. &#x201c;To carry into action deliberately.&#x201d; Commit. <br>Show up for your first day of law school with only a vague notion of why you&#x2019;re there&#x2014;without a clear set of reasons for putting yourself through the punishment you&#x2019;re about to endure&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll be setting yourself up for a miserable and unfulfilling three years. Show up committed, with a well thought-out set of goals supported by reasons for attaining them, and the experience can be exhilarating. <br>The choice is yours. You picked up this book looking for answers, or maybe a &#x201c;quick fix&#x201d; that will put you ahead of your competitors in the rough-and-tumble world of law school. You have it in one word: commit. That&#x2019;s it. Don&#x2019;t &#x201c;decide&#x201d; to go to law school. Don&#x2019;t &#x201c;try&#x201d; law school. Commit to law school. That is the pure axiom of law school success. Commit, or forget it&#x2014;for in law school, to quote the ancient Jedi master Yoda, &#x201c;there is no try.&#x201d; <br>Still with me? <br>Now&nbsp;&#x2026; about the cocky guy next to you who just put this book back on the shelf with a &#x201c;Hrumph&#x201d; after reading these first few paragraphs&#x2014;don&#x2019;t worry about him. That&#x2019;s the overconfident guy who will spend the first weeks of law school casually reading cases, partying in the bars, and teasing you about studying too much. Learn to love that guy because he&#x2019;s someone you&#x2019;re going to flog on your first-semester finals. Trust me on that because I used to know that guy. <br>He was me. <br>Step number one on the road to your commitment to law school is to ask yourself one critical question. Why do you want to go to law school? <br>No really. Think about it. What&#x2019;s driving you? Force yourself to come up with an answer. Now be honest. Does your answer, or something like it, appear on this list? <br>&#x2022; because my mom/dad/sibling/relative/friend is a lawyer <br>&#x2022; because I took the LSAT and got a good score <br>&#x2022; because I&#x2019;m not good at science and wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get into med school <br>&#x2022; because lawyers make good salaries and have financial and/or job security <br>&#x2022; because most of the people at my school are applying to law/med school <br>&#x2022; because I watch&nbsp; <i>Law &amp; Order</i>&nbsp;reruns and think they&#x2019;re interesting <br>&#x2022; because I&#x2019;ve read all of John Grisham&#x2019;s novels and find them fascinating <br>&#x2022; because I don&#x2019;t know what else to do and law is a respectable profession <br>&#x2022; because my parents/relatives/teachers/friends think I&#x2019;m a &#x201c;born lawyer&#x201d; <br>Okay. So if your rationale for going to law school appears above, all is not lost. It just means that you need to rethink your motivations because these just aren&#x2019;t going to cut it for you. Let&#x2019;s dispel some illusions. <br>My relative the lawyer made me do it <br>First of all, what is it about your parent/sibling/friend the lawyer that makes you want to follow him into his profession? Is it the money? The prestige? Do you even know whether this person is happy practicing law? Have you asked him lately? More important, have you ever followed this person through a typical day&#x2014;or even better, a typical week? Ever ask this person what he likes least about the law, or about how much time he spends in court compared to how much time he spends with his nose buried in the books? Ever ask how long it took him to make partner, or how many hours a week he had to work to become partner? Ever ask him how much time he gets to spend with his kids, on his hobbies, or exercising? How her relationships are with her family and friends? These are revealing questions that may help you explore a career in law more realistically. Ask them before you romanticize your relative the lawyer. <br>I can&#x2019;t ignore this amazing LSAT score, can I? <br>Why not? The LSAT is allegedly an aptitude test that predicts how well you&#x2019;ll do in law school, but the accuracy of this correlation is controversial and much debated. A good LSAT score is a tremendous asset when applying to law schools. A whole chapter in this book is devoted to teaching you how to get the best possible score. However, the test bears almost no resemblance to what you&#x2019;ll be doing in law school, and even less to the actual practice of law. Both law school and law practice require well-developed research and writing skills, and to a lesser extent, oral advocacy proficiency, none of which is tested on the LSAT. No legal concepts are tested on the LSAT, which is basically a souped-up, trickier SAT. Yet some would use a good LSAT score to justify law as a career choice. A good LSAT score may bring you to the dance, but it&#x2019;s no guarantee that you&#x2019;ll be happy to be there. <br>I don&#x2019;t have a mind for science, so&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Otherwise known as the old &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be a doctor because I couldn&#x2019;t hack orgo, so I might as well be a lawyer&#x201d; rationale. Trust me, I get it&nbsp;&#x2026; I took orgo twice myself, but seriously, where&#x2019;s the logic in that argument? We&#x2019;re not playing the game of Life here&#x2014;this is the real thing. Contrary to the beliefs of many, there are other career choices besides law, medicine, and investment banking. Maybe you should explore some of them. Take a year off to travel, learn a language, teach, write, or work for a nonprofit or volunteer organization. Start your own business. Think a little and figure out what it is that you like to do. Don&#x2019;t just fall into this ridiculous mind trap and go straight for the law school applications because all your friends are doing it. To quote your mom, &#x201c;If all your friends jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>It&#x2019;s the economy, stupid <br>This is one of the biggest misconceptions of all. If you&#x2019;re going into law because you think it&#x2019;s your road to riches, stop and go directly to business school or ignore the advice in the last section and become an I-banker. That&#x2019;s where the real money is. While associates in big-city law firms&nbsp; <i>do</i>&nbsp;make six-figure salaries right out of law school, in a good year I-bankers at comparably large investment firms commonly make that much in their holiday bonus. Similarly, a successful business idea can bring you a partner-level salary two or three years after start-up, not to mention stock options, a flexible work schedule, and the pleasure of being your own boss. <br>Remember this&#x2014;the average lawyer&#x2019;s salary in the United States is still only about $40,000 per year. Sure, partners at big-city firms may pull down over a million a year&nbsp;&#x2026; but those big salaries generally belong only to the real rainmakers, and it may have taken even them fifteen to twenty years of eighty-hour weeks, two failed marriages, and a heart attack to get there. Clients don&#x2019;t just grow on trees or fall out of the sky. You have to earn the right to represent clients, and that takes serious time and effort. Meanwhile, the prosecutors you&#x2019;ve romanticized from television or the novels you&#x2019;ve read may make as little as $25,000 a year while working the same hours. So don&#x2019;t kid yourself. A career in law does provide some job security and a good assurance that you and your family won&#x2019;t starve on the streets, but if money is your primary motivator, there are much easier ways to make your millions. <br>This ain&#x2019;t Hollywood, son <br>That brings us to the unspoken reason why many people go to law school&#x2014;the secret longing to be Tom Cruise in&nbsp; <i>The Firm</i>, Gregory Peck in&nbsp; <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, Sam Waterston in&nbsp; <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. Unfortunately, this too is a romanticized notion of the law. Most lawyers never make guest appearances on CNN or get to parade secret, star witnesses into court to the gasps of the gallery. The vast majority of cases settle before trial, and the work between intake and settlement is a long, private grind of discovery battles, document review, motion practice, and many hours spent reading, writing, and thinking far from the limelight. If your aspirations about law school center on supercharged days before a jury and invitations to appear on national television after your latest victory, it&#x2019;s time to wake up to the reality of what the practice of law is really like. <br>Most lawyers, even the really good ones, typically toil in the state and lower federal courts, often on mundane legal issues. Most lawyers will never argue before the U.S. Supreme Court, and an appearance before a circuit court of appeals or a chance to break new legal ground may only occur once or twice in a career. That&#x2019;s not to say that your days as a lawyer won&#x2019;t be interesting or intellectually challenging. Many of them will be. But they won&#x2019;t be like what you see in the movies. <br>Finally, remember that even what you see on&nbsp; <i>Law &amp; Order</i>&nbsp;is the culmination of hundreds of hours of hard work in the library reading cases, developing theories, drafting court briefs and memoranda, and taking depositions from unwilling witnesses in law firm conference rooms&#x2014;things the producers will never show you on television. For every hour of court time you log, you may spend hundreds of hours reading, researching, and writing. If you become a civil or criminal litigator or a prosecutor, you&#x2019;ll have your days in court before a judge and jury&#x2014;but if you go to work for a big-city firm, it may take you five to ten years to even see the inside of a courtroom, and even longer to try your own cases. In the meantime, you&#x2019;ll be a researcher&#x2014;analyzing issues, finding applicable cases, and writing memoranda to the more senior associates and partners in the firm. You&#x2019;ll typically be asked to work sixty-to-eighty-hour weeks, late nights, and at least some weekends. <br>Your fate is typically better in a smaller firm, or working for a state or federal prosecutor. Doing so can bring these opportunities much more rapidly&#x2014;often within the first year or two, but these positions typically pay much less. <br>On the corporate side, it is much the same story. If you want to become a dealmaker in a large city, you&#x2019;ll need to get in line. For the first few years, you&#x2019;ll be paid handsomely to draft boilerplate agreements and spend late nights at the printer arguing over the placement of commas in merger agreements and initial public offerings. Remember that at a big firm, there may be sixty to eighty starry-eyed associates in your &#x201c;class,&#x201d; all of whom want the same plum assignments that you do. Someone has to do the scut work, though, and for the first few years, that will be you. While smaller firms again offer more rapid opportunity, the deals are also smaller. Further, someone still has to proofread these agreements&#x2014;and that someone is still going to be you. Oh&#x2014;and if you&#x2019;re thinking of going the in-house route, remember that most corporations won&#x2019;t even consider hiring someone right out of law school. You&#x2019;ll need some years of firm experience first, unless you hook up with your friend&#x2019;s start-up company, and if you do, remember that 95 percent of these &#x201c;start-up&#x201d; companies never actually get anywhere. <br>Of course, there are exceptions to all these scenarios. Partners in big firms will occasionally take promising young associates under their wings, channel them interesting and important work, or provide them with uncommon opportunities to sit &#x201c;third chair&#x201d; in a trial, or to help &#x201c;put the deal together.&#x201d; Be clear, though: These are the exceptions, not the rule. The road to partnership is paved with disillusioned associates who became bored and disenchanted with the work they were given and left voluntarily, or who, after seven years spent toiling in the mines, were told that they were not on the partner track and should look elsewhere for employment. In a typical large firm, of an entering class of forty to eighty associates, only a small handful, maybe three to five, will survive to make partner eight or ten years later. <br>Hey, you! Yeah, you&#x2014;the one with the distressed look on your face about to reach for that copy of&nbsp; <i>Med School Confidential</i>&nbsp;instead. Relax. It&#x2019;s not all bad. It&#x2019;s just that there are so many people out there with misconceptions about law practice that we need to clear away the delusions up front to approach this experience with more realistic expectations. Now that we&#x2019;ve done this, it&#x2019;s time for more introspection. Let&#x2019;s explore whether you have an accurate picture of what your law school experience will entail. As you read the questions that follow, carefully consider the answers that come from within. Pay particular attention if a &#x201c;Yeah, but&#x2026;&#x201d; comes up. Trust me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s better to deal with this crisis now than to experience it a month into your first semester. <br>A REALISTIC EVALUATION OF YOUR FITNESS FOR LAW SCHOOL <br>Go somewhere where you can be undisturbed for the next thirty minutes or so and force yourself to answer the following questions honestly. What follows is a realistic picture of the day-to-day grind of law school. In many ways, it&#x2019;s also an accurate picture of the day-to-day life of a young lawyer. So forget the glamorous pictures of law practice you&#x2019;ve seen on television and in the movies and be honest with yourself. While few people will find themselves completely in love with the thought of spending their next three years holed up in a library, if what you see below is too far out of sync with what drives you, your misery may last much longer than the three years you&#x2019;ll be in school. <br>&#x2022; How comfortable are you with the idea of spending the majority of each day in silence, reading difficult material? <br>&#x2022; Do you or could you have the stamina to read dry, complicated material for four to six hours a day, every day? <br>&#x2022; Are you self-reliant, or do you depend on others for constant encouragement, evaluation, and/or affirmation? <br>&#x2022; Can you seize the main points of an assignment and move on, or do you typically get hopelessly bogged down in detail? <br>&#x2022; Are you disciplined enough to get up and attend classes every day? <br>&#x2022; Are you comfortable speaking out in class and arguing in front of others? <br>&#x2022; Have you been able to &#x201c;will&#x201d; yourself through difficult periods in your life? <br>&#x2022; When you don&#x2019;t understand something, are you capable of teaching yourself? <br>&#x2022; Do you enjoy doing research, searching through books in a library or online databases, for pieces to a puzzle or &#x201c;the answer&#x201d; to a problem? <br>&#x2022; Do you like to write critically and analytically? <br>&#x2022; Is your personality more proactive than reactive? <br>&#x2022; When you&#x2019;ve given your best effort, will you be able to sleep at night knowing that you&#x2019;ve done the best you could, or are you more likely to beat yourself up wondering if there was more you could have done? <br>&#x2022; Are you ready to make the law your life for the next three years by subverting most of your hobbies, other interests, and your social life to serious academic dedication? <br>It&#x2019;s probably obvious from the way these questions were worded, but you&#x2019;re looking for mostly yes responses&#x2014;or at least the probability that you&#x2019;ll be able to work up to yes responses on each of these questions. If you&#x2019;ve had too many &#x201c;oh-ohs&#x201d; during this evaluation, you should take that as a warning. For example, if you don&#x2019;t like to read, you&#x2019;re making a big mistake applying to...</p><h2>Hypnotherapy Scripts 2nd Edition</h2><p><em>Hypnotherapy Scripts, 2nd Edition</em> is a straightforward, practical guide for doing Ericksonian hypnotherapy.

She now lives in the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb of Stone Mountain. In 1997, she founded Amaru Entertainment/Records as a vehicle through which her son's work could continue to be legitimately released after his murder. Since then, Amaru Entertainment has successfully released several chart-topping albums as well a book of Tupac's original poetry with an accompanying CD -- both titled <i>The Rose that Grew from Concrete</i> -- as well as the movie, book, and soundtrack <i>Tupac: Resurrection.</i> <p> Ms. Shakur also founded the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, Inc., based in Georgia, which provides opportunities for young people to pursue their creative and artistic dreams. The foundation is also on a mission to build the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, a multipurpose performance arts center in Stone Mountain, Georgia. This is her first book.</p><p><b>Chapter ONE: The Stuff</b> </p><p> "<i>It's important to know the stuff you came from</i>." </p><p> -- Afeni Shakur </p><p><br> I travel east on I-20 as the sun sets behind me, passing exits I no longer recognize. Old fears of being lost on the highway in Stone Mountain, Georgia, resurface, even though I'm told it's no longer the crackerland of my childhood. Black folk live out here now, far beyond the parameters of my youth. Today, Atlanta stretches past Cumberland Mall, Six Flags, and even Stone Mountain. Things have changed and I missed the transition. I feel strangely stuck right in the middle of my life. There was a time when my life was <i>all</i> ahead of me. Today, there is a big chunk behind me and maybe just as much in front. All this means is, I still have time to change my attitudes and sensibilities, but I am just less inclined to do so. Let's say I'm just a little less flexible. Like an uncle of mine who still says "colored" instead of "black." He just never got used to saying "Black" or "Negro," and didn't understand what difference it made or why he had to make a change. The change was irrelevant to him..."African-American" was out of the question. </p><p> So, the irony of the famed revolutionary and impassioned mother of a rapper -- superstar Tupac Shakur -- now residing in suburban, once-Klan-country Georgia is not lost on me. In fact, I have learned to expect the unexpected from Afeni Shakur. Not because she means to be complex or contradictory, but because she just is. That is her truth, and it's a truth that fascinates me. I've grown to love my friend Afeni. </p><p> As I drive I think back to December 1, 1994, the day I met Afeni. At the time, I was writing a screenplay about a fictitious young woman in the '60s who was raising her daughter while still living with her own mother. The piece was, or still is if I ever get finished writing it, a three-generation piece about Black women. The young woman in the middle is a fictitious, composite character of Angela Davis and Afeni Shakur. My plan was to meet Afeni and hopefully have her help me develop this particular character and perhaps give me her insights on the other two. </p><p> The way I met her was not how I'd imagined, though. In fact, I was thrust into a tumultuous family trauma her son, my friend, Tupac, had been brutally shot five times in the foyer of a New York recording studio on a Sunday night; had left Bellevue Hospital on a Monday, and was in court on a Tuesday morning for a sexual assault hearing. So, on December 1, 1994, I was early for the court hearing and waiting in a vast hallway with Jada Pinkett, a close friend of mine and an even closer friend to Tupac Shakur. We were waiting to get a glimpse of Tupac on his way into court and let him know we were near and there for him. At that time, I didn't even know the charges or the circumstances of the trial. I just knew that Tupac was shot the night before in the entrance of the recording studio, and I needed to be there to support my friends -- Jada and Tupac. </p><p> The crazy events of the last two days had me reeling, but I tried to consciously stay in the moment. <i>It is Tuesday morning. Tuesday morning. You're in New York. You're at the courthouse.</i> I remember talking myself into the present moment of that day, but I kept slipping out. <i>Tupac is shot. Someone shot Tupac.</i> Today is Tuesday morning...<i>Five times! Who did it? He's at Bellevue</i>....That was Monday, which would be yesterday....<i>He's out. Tupac's gone. He left. The hospital? He didn't feel safe up in there. At Bellevue? Monday, that was yesterday. Where is he? I don't know, but I'm going to New York</i>. Here I am Tuesday morning at the courthouse. <i>Just be here. Just be present. Someone may need you.</i> </p><p> And that's where I was -- jumping back and forth in my head -- this Monday, the day I first saw Afeni Shakur. A tight group clustered at the end of the hall, surrounding a wheelchair holding an ashen, bandaged, diminutive Tupac. Two women headed the clan that hovered over him, and I later learned that his family was indeed a "clan." At the time, however, it just looked to me like a bunch of <i>folk</i>. I mistook the lady in charge to be Afeni at first notice, but the lady was Glo, Afeni's sister. Afeni stood beside her. Glo was stern and serious, as I had imagined Afeni would be, and Glo checked me out when she first saw me, like I was some little wannabee trying to get next to Tupac. Afeni, on the other hand, was warmer. She embraced me like I was an old friend. Little did I know I would grow to be just that -- an old friend. </p><p> I sit with this memory of December 1994 when I first met Afeni. I sit with this memory now in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as I approach the long driveway of Afeni's house -- the house Tupac bought for her. Eight years later, I get to sit with my Afeni, and I relish my time alone in her world. She wants to talk of origins, beginnings. She is ready now to reveal her own history. She is ready now because she's taken some time with herself to reflect on her life. She needed this time because her beloved son died. He didn't die the first time he was shot five times in the foyer of the New York recording studio, but he was shot again two years later in Las Vegas. And this time, she lost him. September 13, 1996. So, Afeni needed some time to look at her life and work out why she is still here. Now, she wants to tell <i>her</i> story, and she called me to tell it to. She says she's been back to her home and has spent some time with her people. She understands more about her mama, her daddy, and their mamas and daddies. She's had some time to go back home to Lumberton, North Carolina, and Norfolk, Virginia, and revisit where her life began as Alice Faye Williams. </p><p><br> Her house is set back from the street. I park next to a few cars in the driveway, and I recognize one of them as Tupac's prized Mercedes. I smile and walk up the steps to Afeni's front door. It is ajar, so, I just step in and yell a few "hellos." </p><p> "I'm in the back," Afeni calls. </p><p> I follow her voice through the airy living room and wood-paneled den. On the walls are powerful oil portraits of Tupac. The photos on the mantel above the brick fireplace celebrate Afeni's babies, her grandchildren, nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews, and the offspring of her ex-comrades and their children's children. A generation has passed since the revolution. My baby, Imani, is up there too. And I realize I am part of this family as well, and I'm grateful for the inclusion. </p><p> I reach Afeni's bedroom only to find her backlit in the doorway of her veranda, her silhouetted arms reaching out to me. I get closer and I see her glistening eyes smile broadly. She hugs me, strong and hearty, as if she were a big ole man instead of the small-boned little lady she is. I enjoy Afeni's hug. It carries weight and time and the sense that it may be the last one. So I hold on tight. There aren't many people in my life this happy to see me and she always is. </p><p> "Afeni," I say. "I can't believe your house. It's so warm and inviting and -- " </p><p> "I got furniture," she proclaims. </p><p> We laugh and I add, "I didn't crawl over lumps of sleeping teenagers on the floor either. And it's light in here. And clear." </p><p> "Yeah," Afeni says. "I only smoke back here now, in my room and on my porch. 'Cause of the kids, you know." </p><p> "It's lovely, Fe. I'm proud of you." Having a house that is a home is a major accomplishment for Afeni, who has spent most of her adult life an impoverished gypsy. In dire straits she always stayed with her sister Glo, and dire straits were frequent. </p><p> "Come on out here." Afeni leads the way. "Come on out here on my porch." </p><p> The porch is deep and long, and wraps around the house like a huge knitted scarf. In one corner, Afeni's chaise lounge sits to the right of a small table. Another cushioned chair to the left of the small table faces the sprawling pine forest of her backyard. In the farthest corner a large color TV flickers, on mute, but full of CNN. </p><p> "Shit, you might as well move the bed out here, too," I exclaim. I've never seen a TV on an outdoor porch before. I nestle in my chair and let the warm, rich Georgia air rest on my face. God, I miss humidity. </p><p> "This is all I ever wanted," Afeni says. "This right here? This is the best thing Tupac ever did for me." </p><p> "It is nice, Afeni, and very peaceful." I began to see why she's in Stone Mountain. </p><p> "Land. We always wanted land. Shit, I come from sharecroppers. Of course, they wanted land, too. They understood the value of <i>owning</i> your own land, 'cause they never owned nothing. My great-grandmother, Millie Ann, she was the last person in our family to have land, and it has taken all this time for us to own land again Now, Black people want trinkets, cars and clothes, and shit. That's part of the genocide, the loss of values. It is killing us, as a people." </p><p> Afeni shakes her head. "Millie Ann had land, and she lost it. Her sons got busted, and she put the house up for bail. Then it burned down. Black people had land, you know, but we lost it. It was hard to keep it, though, but when that land got taken, it broke us down a little more. So, the next time the children came up, they didn't know it is the <i>land</i> that is important. Now, they think the trinket is important 'cause their parents and their parents before them didn't own shit." </p><p> "And they died owning nothing," I add. </p><p> "And nothing to pass down," Afeni says. </p><p> "The Cadillac parked in front of unit B in the projects," I say to Afeni, the vision dear to me. Having grown up near a project in Atlanta, I get what she's saying about our skewed values. </p><p> "Exactly, but if you got your land, that's what you work for. I don't need no clothes, jewelry, and shit. Because now I work to keep the land. I want a generator in case the electricity goes out. I want space so if someone needs a place to live, they can put a trailer up right there and have a home. I want my grandchildren to know how to garden and cultivate their own food. I want them to know because I come from farmers and people of the land and I lost it. You see that," Afeni points to a patch of dark soil with cabbage, lettuce, carrots thriving. "I tried to do that garden and I got calluses and shit. I burned my hands up! That shit is hard work. Them women in those days, my great-grandmother, my people, they worked their butts off from sunup to sundown to keep it up. You can't be spending your money on trinkets if you have to keep up your land." </p><p> I join in. "When I first got <i>A Different World</i> I bought a house. Actually, I did a Burger King commercial for sixty grand, and that was my down payment. Before I bought a nice car or a nice stereo system, I made sure I had a home that I owned." </p><p> Afeni taps my thigh. "Yes," she says excitedly. "Priority. And I'm glad your people taught you that. You knew early. It's taken me so many years to find my priority in life, only to come right back here where I began. Now, I know what I'm working for and striving for. The real estate man who showed me this place was happy to sell it to me, you know, until he found out who my son was. Then he wanted me to go and get a big ole fancy house." </p><p> "Yes, 'cause your son's a superstar! You need some marble and a fountain, some gates and some statues, a swimming pool!" I laugh because such showy opulence would be untrue to Afeni's real self. </p><p> "And I wanted the <i>land</i>, not the house. The land, to live on and to cultivate and pass on to my family." </p><p> Afeni inhales her Newport and surveys the deep forest green of her backyard. I notice new saplings planted on the edge of her small pine forest. </p><p> "Those new trees are what the babies planted," Afeni says proudly. </p><p> Afeni's "babies" are the Shakur family's next generation. The two sisters, Glo and Afeni, are at the helm -- they are the keepers of the brood. Sekyiwa, Afeni's daughter, and Tupac's sister, has two children -- Nzingha and Malik. Jamala, Glo's daughter, has one daughter -- Imani. Katari, Glo's son, has a daughter as well, Kyira, the same name as my daughter. And on any given day, these cousins roam Afeni's yard, raid her refrigerator, and laugh up the rooms of her Stone Mountain refuge. </p><p> "Nzingha wanted a pine tree. So, that's her tree right there. That one is Imani's. And Leeki [Malik], he wanted a fruit-bearing tree. This one's his and look...there's some fruit! We plant a tree for Tupac on his birthday every year. Either here or on the farm." </p><p> Afeni also owns a 56-acre farm in Lumberton, North Carolina. She invites me to go there often, but I'm reluctant to travel too far from my double-tall, two-sugar-in-the-raw nonfat lattes. </p><p> "You got to come, Jasmine," Afeni insists. "Bring the children. Children love it. I got cows and pigs. We grow our own vegetables -- organic vegetables, without those chemicals and hormones that are killing our kids. We give away these clean vegetables to the people of Robeson County. They work the land, and they sell the produce. It's for them and by them." Afeni gets excited. "You see, Lumberton is the poorest county in North Carolina. Robeson County -- the poorest. And what this means is..." </p><p> Afeni looks nothing like she did when I first met her in the halls of the courthouse doting over her bandaged son. Then, she was reticent, kind of caved in. She looked sad and tired, worried and scared. She was skinny then, too, maybe one hundred pounds and some change. Now, when I look at her beaming over her newly planted trees, her skin has some red in it, and her head is full of new thick hair -- short and healthy without the patches of distress that once wore through. </p><p> "I've got some Lumbees helping me with my land," Afeni continues. "They come every day and work the land." </p><p> "What's a Lumbi?" I picture little gnomelike creatures with green skin and snakelike tails that only till the land at night. </p><p> "Lumbee's are Indians indigenous to that part of North Carolina." </p><p> "Lumbee. Never heard of them. But isn't that Cherokee country?" </p><p> "No, the Lumbee Indian came from the Sioux and Cheraw. They mixed with some Spanish explorers early on. Then, you know, the English and Scottish came and they mixed with them, too. By that time, they started to lose their language and their customs and nobody knew what to call them. They were all mixed up." </p><p> "They spoke English?" </p><p> "Yes," Afeni is emphatic. "I'm telling you, they lost their culture and their language but they stayed separate. They knew they were Indians. They just needed a name. First they were Croatan Indians. Then they were Robeson County Indians. Then, the Cherokee of Robeson County. They've been called a lot of names. Lumbee came after a long fight to be recognized by the North Carolina legislature as a tribe. They named themselves after the Lumbee River." </p><p> Afeni takes a long drink of water, grabs her pack of Newports and continues. "I thought my great-grandmother married a Lumbee. Well, at least part Lumbee, part white dude, but he was just a white dude, really poor white trash." </p><p> "Was this your great-grandmother's second marriage?" </p><p> "No. This was her first." </p><p> "Then, this is your gre...</p></p><h2>Database Management Systems</h2><p>&#34;Database Management Systems&#34; provides comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of the fundamentals of database systems.

Among them were the Mongols of the thirteenth century--a small tribe, which, under the charismatic leadership of Genghis Khan, created the largest contiguous land empire in history. Inspired by the extraordinary life nomads lead, Tim Cope embarked on a journey that hadn't been successfully completed since those times: to travel on horseback across the entire length of the Eurasian steppe, from Karakorum, the ancient capital of Mongolia, through Kazakhstan, Russia, Crimea and the Ukraine to the Danube River in Hungary. </p><p>From horse-riding novice to spending months in the saddle, he learnt to fend off wolves and would-be horse-thieves, and grapple with the haunting extremes of the steppe as he crossed sub-zero plateaux, the scorching deserts of Kazakhstan and the high-mountain passes of the Carpathians. As he travelled he formed a close bond with his horses and especially his dog Tigon, and encountered essential hospitality--the linchpin of human survival on the steppe--from those he met along the way.</p><p>Cope bears witness to how the traditional ways hang in the balance in the post-Soviet world--an era that has brought new-found freedom, but also the perils of corruption and alcoholism, and left a world bereft of both the Communist system upon which it once relied, and the traditional knowledge of the nomadic forefathers. </p><p>A journey of adventure, endurance and eventual triumph, <i>On the Trail of Genghis Khan</i> is at once a celebration of and an elegy for an ancient way of life.</p></p><p><p><b>Tim Cope</b> is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and an award-winning adventurer, author, filmmaker and motivational speaker with a special interest in Central Asia and states of the former Soviet Union.

It is an intriguing system of principles and practice designed to give each individual the experience of eternity in a split second, the knowledge of divinity in every living thing. To create a book about Zen, however, is risky. It is one thing to describe the factual history of this exotic strain of Buddhism. Itï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s quite another to successfully convey the crazy wisdom of the Zen masters, their zany sense of their uncanny ability to pass on the experience of enlightenment to their students. The authors of <i>Zen For Beginners</i> have clearly overcome these considerable risks.

Rhys, born in 1890 in Dominica, the West Indies, had a Welsh father and a mother who was a Dominican Creole. The Creole influence would pervade her life and writing. At the age of 17, Rhys left Dominica to go to England, where she tried several careers--actor, chorus girl, artist's model--before she started to write. Her familiarity with the seedy side of London life is evident in her novels, many of which have the repeated theme of the helpless female, victimized by her dependence on a man for support and protection. Rhys had numerous love affairs throughout her long life; even at age 80, she enjoyed flirting with critic Alfred Alvarez, whose article about her in The New York Times Book Review on March 17, 1974, ``The Best Living English Novelist,'' made Rhys, briefly, a best seller. After several early novels such as After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie (1931) and Voyage in the Dark (1935), she stopped writing. Then she published Wide Sargasso Sea (1967), her story of the first marriage of Mr. Rochester of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Many of Rhys's novels have autobiographical origins, and Angier, an English writer and teacher, seems determined to connect every inhalation in Rhys's life with an exhalation in one of her novels. Thus, the reader stumbles through explanatory parentheses (as many as six a page), interspersed with speculative phrases (``I think''; ``Did she know? I doubt very much''; ``Would she have? Surely not''). Perhaps Angier's exhaustive but unsorted research will be of value to some future biographer who will do justice to Rhys, a fine writer. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In 1973 critic Al Alvarez called her the best living English novelist, and in the same year PW reported a "rush" on her novels, among them Quartet, Voyage in the Dark and her masterpiece, Wide Sargasso Sea. Rhys (1890-1979) was an odd bundle of qualities that included narcissism, paranoia, charm, self-pity, self-destructiveness, rage against men and a general wildness of temperament that owed something to the steamy island of Dominica where she was born. But as British freelance writer Angier amply shows in this hefty critical biography--where fact and insight lie cheek by jowl--she was adept at "distilling truth out of evasion and art out of pain." For her (and her heroines), loving meant losing, a lesson acquired through several marriages and passionate affairs, the most formative, from the literary point of view, with Ford Madox Ford. Perhaps this impressive study will trigger another rush on a poetic novelist now suffering a mild neglect.

Du Bois Lectures)</h2><p><p>Speaking wisely and provocatively about the political economy of race, Glenn Loury has become one of our most prominent black intellectuals--and, because of his challenges to the orthodoxies of both left and right, one of the most controversial. A major statement of a position developed over the past decade, this book both epitomizes and explains Loury's understanding of the depressed conditions of so much of black society today--and the origins, consequences, and implications for the future of these conditions.</p><p>Using an economist's approach, Loury describes a vicious cycle of tainted social information that has resulted in a self-replicating pattern of racial stereotypes that rationalize and sustain discrimination. His analysis shows how the restrictions placed on black development by stereotypical and stigmatizing racial thinking deny a whole segment of the population the possibility of self-actualization that American society reveres--something that many contend would be undermined by remedies such as affirmative action. On the contrary, this book persuasively argues that the promise of fairness and individual freedom and dignity will remain unfulfilled without some forms of intervention based on race.</p><p>Brilliant in its account of how racial classifications are created and perpetuated, and how they resonate through the social, psychological, spiritual, and economic life of the nation, this compelling and passionate book gives us a new way of seeing--and, perhaps, seeing beyond--the damning categorization of race in America.</p></p><p>Glenn C. Loury is Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences in the Department of Economics at Brown University. A distinguished economic theorist, Loury&#x2019;s many scholarly articles include contributions to the fields of welfare economics, game theory, industrial organization, natural resource economics, and the economics of income distribution. He is also a prominent social critic and public intellectual.&#x201c;Coolly, clearly, and relentlessly, Glenn Loury traces the devastating effects of racial stigmatization on relations between blacks and whites in America. He uses the analytic tools of economics deftly without for a moment falling into pomp or mystification. No one has better stated the case against presuming that liberal states and free markets will of themselves dissolve unjust inequalities.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Tilly, Professor of Sociology and Political Science, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;According to Glenn Loury, the problem of racial inequality should no longer be seen as one of racial discrimination. The fundamental problem is one of racial stigma, which contributes to the second-class citizenship of African-Americans. This fact-filled, impossible-to-pigeonhole, impressively interdisciplinary book should inaugurate a new and better discussion of racial equality in America--and with any luck, new and better policies as well.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cass Sunstein, Professor of Law, University of Chicago</b><br><br>&#x201c;In these lectures, the distinguished economist Glenn Loury has reoriented the public discussion on black-white inequality. He has drawn on economic and sociological analyses to emphasize the historical roots essential to understanding the social stigma which underlies the more overt forms of discrimination and inhibits the development of black capabilities. His analysis implies a critique of liberal individually-based political philosophy, while at the same time recognizing its virtues.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kenneth J. Arrow, Professor Emeritus of Economics, Stanford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is social criticism at its best. Glenn Loury provides an original and highly persuasive account of how the American racial hierarchy is sustained and reproduced over time. And he then demands that we begin the deep structural reforms that will be necessary to stop its continued reproduction.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Walzer, Professor of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton</b><br><br>&#x201c;This strikingly original book will likely emerge as one of the most important analyses in recent times of America's unyielding problem of "race". In four tight, intensely argued chapters, Loury compellingly elucidates the often tragic "rationality" of discriminatory behavior that results, less from raw racist antipathy than from the logic of self-confirming stereotypes, as well as the role of social stigma, collective dishonor and exclusion, in explaining persisting racial inequalities. In a clear, crisp style, he dissects the simplicities of conservative cultural determinism, the moral and logical limitations of "color-blind" liberal individualism, and the intellectual complacency of the conventional left who would explain all with the dated cry of attitudinal racism. Loury demonstrates once again how the best insights of economics can be integrated with those of sociology and policy studies to untangle the tortuous "cycles of cumulative causation" beneath the nation's most vexing social problem. Powerfully argued, relentlessly honest, and morally engaged, it lifts and transforms the discourse on "race" and racial justice to an entirely new level and may just be the breakthrough text we have long been waiting for.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Orlando Patterson</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a brilliant book. With an original conceptual framework, Glenn Loury breaks new ground in the study of racial inequality in the United States. His insightful analysis of why "racial stigma" is a more important concept than "racial discrimination" in explaining African American disadvantages and in determining the kinds of reforms needed to address them is bound to generate an important debate among scholars in the field.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Julius Wilson</b><br><br>&#x201c;A fresh, challenging analysis of the racial inequality endured by African-Americans. Loury first presented these arguments as the W. E. B. DuBois Lectures at Harvard in April 2000. One of his principal observations is that those who consider racial issues should replace the concept of racial discrimination with thatof "racial stigma." People are stigmatized, he says, when they are viewed by others not as individuals but as members of a race. He believes that American blacks have<br>patently suffered the most from stigmatization and identifies slavery as the chief cause...There's no question that this is a significant, even crucial text gravid with vital ideas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this highly persuasive analysis of race stigma in U.S. society, Loury...argues that it is not simply racial discrimination (which is "about how people are treated") that keeps African-Americans from achieving their goals, but rather the more complex reality of "racial stigma"--"which is about who, at the deepest cognitive level, they are understood to be"...[Loury] grapples eloquently and vigorously with such concrete examples as affirmative action, arguments about racial IQ differences and racial profiling...Loury's arguments are provocative and productive.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In [<i>The Anatomy of Racial Inequality</i>] Loury makes a striking departure from the self-help themes of his earlier work, defending affirmative action and denouncing "colorblindedness" as a euphemism for indifference to the fate of black Americans. [The book] offers a bracing philosophical defense of his new views. Returning to an argument he first presented in his dissertation, Loury argues that blacks are no longer held back by "discrimination in contract"--discrimination in the job market--but rather by "discrimination in contact," informal and entirely legal patterns of socializing and networking that tend to exclude blacks and thereby perpetuate racial inequality. At the root of this unofficial discrimination, he says is "stigma," a subtle yet pervasive form of antiblack bias.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Shatz</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this fascinating and original book, Loury is both a renowned economist and the director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University. In this fascinating and original book, he combines those two qualifications to examine why, a century and a half after the abolition of slavery and 50 years past the beginning of the U.S. civil rights movement, there are still such inequalities between whites and African Americans. The result is a thoughtful, interdisciplinary book that argues that it isn't racial discrimination but racial stigma ("which is about who, at the deepest level, they are understood to be") that sustains the inequality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Globe and Mail</i></b></p><h2>The Assassin King (The Symphony of Ages)</h2><p><p><i>The Assassin King </i>opens at winter's end with the arrival by sea of a mysterious hunter, a man of ancient race and purpose, who endlessly chants the names of the pantheon of demons that are his intended victims, as well as one other: Ysk, the original name of the Brother, now known as Achmed, the Assassin King of Ylorc. </p><p>At the same moment of this portentous arrival, two gatherings of great import are taking place.

She draws on the imagery of these visits in the Symphony of Ages series, and blends her love of music, anthropology, herbalism and folklore into much of her writing. Haydon is also a harpist and a madrigal singer (a singer of medieval songs). She lives with her family on the East Coast.Chapter One&nbsp;Western seacoast, Avonderre<br>&nbsp;<br>On a morning of unsurpassed fineness, the sun rose over an incandescent sea, rippling with light so bright as to be painful in its radiance. The winter wind dancing over the gleaming waves, fresh with the sweet hint of a spring coming far away in the southlands, carried with it the scent of blood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rath cursed and lowered his head to his chest, pulling his brown hood farther down over his stinging eyes. He waited for the water beneath his translucent eyelids to clear, then blinked several times and looked up again at the shoreline. The sea was so calm that the edge of the land barely wavered in the distance. Rath clutched the oar in his sinewy hands and put his back into rowing for the beach.<br>&nbsp;<br>With each stroke, each pull, each screech of wood against the oarlock of his small boat, he canted his list of targets, every one of their names engraved permanently on his memory. Hrarfa, Fraax, Sistha, Hnaf, Ficken, he whispered in the odd, buzzlike language of his ancient race, the one form of speech that was inaudible to the wind. Rath was always careful not to put information on the wind, especially the sea wind, where it would blow recklessly about the wide world, to be heard by any ear that knew how to listen. Rath was well aware of the loose tongue of the wind; he had been born of that ephemeral element.<br>&nbsp;<br>He gritted his teeth as he rowed, mentally cursing the waves over which he traveled. Water had long blocked his Seeking vibration and kept him from his quarry. Each stroke moved him closer to being free of it, but that did little to calm his growing ire. Until he was away from the sea and the cacophony of thick vibrations that it generated, he would be unable to hunt. So he concentrated, as always, on his list.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hrarfa, Fraax, Sistha, Hnaf, Ficken.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once through the roster of would-be victims that had been his agenda for as long as he could recall, he silently intoned one last name that had been recently added.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ysk.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was not a name in the language of the others, but rather one that had been conferred on its owner by an ignorant species, a demi-human race that barely formed words at all. Ysk was the Firbolg word for spittle, for the regurgitation of something foul. That monsters had given someone such a title could only convey the deepest disgust, contempt that had no limit.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was perhaps the worst name that Rath had ever heard.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was also a dead name, a name whose power had been broken more than a millennium before, whose history lay at the bottom of the sea on the other side of the world. A name all but forgotten, indeed, completely erased from the wind and from memory, except for the recollection of Rath and his kind.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was the last name on his list, but the first one he would actively seek upon landing.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the beach was finally close enough that rowing was disproportionate effort, Rath climbed out of the boat and left it drifting in the tide. He had sighted his landing carefully so as to be able to come ashore unnoticed in a small, rocky alcove between two fishing villages. His luck was holding; there was no one in sight for as far up and down the beach as he could see.<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned away from the sea wind with one last glance over his shoulder; the little boat was slowly backing away in a graceless dance, spinning aimlessly in the current. Rath waded to shore, ignoring the pebbles and seaweed that coated the sand beneath his feet. His soles had no nerves in them anyway, the calluses from millennia of walking through fire were almost as thick as a boot would have been.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once on the beach, he hurried forward until the scrambling froth of the waves was no longer able to reach him, then stopped in the cold, dry sand, pulled back his hood, and tilted his head to the southwest, listening to the wind. He waited for the span of a hundred heartbeats, but no voices akin to his own could be heard; none of his fellow hunters had anything to report, as was the case most of the time.<br>&nbsp;<br>As it had been for centuries into millennia.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rath lingered a moment longer, then turned his back to the west, away from the crashing of the waves and the rustling of the foam. He took a breath of the salt wind, inhaling over the four openings of his windpipe, clenched his teeth, and loosed his kirai, the Seeking vibration by which his race sought their prey. The buzzing sound came forth from the deepest opening in his throat, a vibration heard only by him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then he opened his mouth, allowing the air that was rising from within his lungs to pass over the top opening in his throat, forming words again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hrarfa, Fraax, Sistha, Hnaf, Ficken.<br>&nbsp;<br>One by one he canted the names of the demon spirits he was hunting, feeling the slight variation in tone as he changed from one name to another. If the kirai matched any of those names to a vibration it detected in the air, his throat would burn as if with caustic fire; he would taste the beast's blood in his mouth, feel its heartbeat in his own chest. He could lock on to that rhythm and follow it.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, as always, there was no taste of any of the names on the wind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, he intoned the last name.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ysk.<br>&nbsp;<br>This name, of course, was different. Unlike the others, it was the dead name of a living being, a name once given, in another lifetime, to a man with a soul. However tainted that soul might be by the ravages of time and personal failure, it could never be as acidly evil as the essence of the demonic beings Rath and his fellow demon hunters regularly pursued. And however dead the name might be, Rath had reason to believe its original owner was, in fact, still alive, though his vibrational signature had changed along with his name.<br>&nbsp;<br>And not long before, he had heard the dead name, spoken aloud, on the nattering wind. He hoped to get a taste of it once more, now that he had crossed the sea and finally come ashore in the place to which he had tracked the name, the place it seemed to have been last spoken.<br>&nbsp;<br>He inhaled, letting the wind pass over his tongue, then canted the name.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ysk.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a remnant of it still on the wind coming from the southeast, though faint and hollow; perhaps it had been years since it had been voiced. Still, this continent, this place known in old lore as the Wyrmlands, was the place where the name had last been sounded. Rath could taste that much.<br>&nbsp;<br>Satisfied, he stripped his pack from beneath his cloak, opening it carefully on the sandy ground as the wind whipped off the sea, buffeting the skin of his naked head. He quickly checked his provisions and the minimal tools of his trade, as well as the dagger he wore in a calf sheath. The weapon was little more than a child's knife, meant only for the meanest of self-defense against any beast or man that he might not be able to otherwise avoid. No one who observed him would consider him armed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rath carried his deadliest weapons in his head.<br>&nbsp;<br>Determining his water supply to be sufficient, he quickly repacked his provisions and slung the pack beneath his flowing brown cloak. Then he glanced at the sea one last time; the little boat was no longer in sight, lost in the blazing glare of the rising sun.<br>&nbsp;<br>A moment later, to any eye other than his own, so was Rath.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright ï¿½ 2006 by Elizabeth Haydon.

It seems like longer than a year has passed since I sat for my examinations, since I enrolled at the college. Doing nothing has a way of slowing time. The college shut down after the professors got scared and quit teaching, when both the school and the faculty became easy targets for the Sikh mobs. And with no school, with nothing changing but the way people all over Punjab seem to have gone crazy, I&#x2019;ve felt stuck. Trapped, even.<br> <br>But now. Now there is hope.<br> <br>My hand sneaks into my pocket, just to make sure the slip of paper is still there. I have already memorized the number of the house on Mani Margh, the time of my appointment with this Darnsley man, the few details about the job. I don&#x2019;t need the paper anymore. All the same, I like knowing it&#x2019;s there, like a railway ticket. Proof that I have someplace to be.<br> <br>Someplace other than Abbu&#x2019;s shops, selling gold and stones.<br> <br>And maybe, just maybe, someplace other than India altogether.<br> <br>This Mr. Darnsley must have gone to Oxford. Why else would this chance come?<br> <br>I walk half a mile, rubbing the paper like some kind of talisman, my mind racing ahead to how hard I&#x2019;ll work to impress this Englishman. It&#x2019;s perfect, really, the timing of it all. I&#x2019;m so lost in my thoughts that I don&#x2019;t notice the crowd of men running up the lane behind me until they overtake and surround me.<br> <br>I let go of the paper and brace myself for a fight before I see the men are Muslim, most of them around my age. A few wear prayer caps, but there is not a pagri on the head of any of them, and all have hair cropped close like mine. My hands uncurl.<br> <br>They are not interested in me. Let them pass.<br> <br>But then one stops a few yards ahead, turns around. &#x201c;Tariq!&#x201d;<br> <br>My hands clench.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sameer,&#x201d; I say. Sameer. There&#x2019;s always trouble when Sameer turns up. Even when we were at school together, he had a way of finding trouble, of drawing me into it.<br> <br>He fights the current of the men, grabs my arm, and pulls me into the flow.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; he asks, smiling. He is a little winded. The mob is keeping up a quick pace. There must be twenty or thirty men here.<br> <br>Up ahead, two of them break off from the pack, dash over to a market stall, and snatch up armfuls of cricket bats. They&#x2019;re already back in step before the shopkeeper even has a chance to say anything. Not that he would. Not that any of the people in the shops would. They have all stopped to watch.<br> <br>Someone near the front begins the chant. &#x201c;Pa-ki-stan Zin-da-bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>The stolen bats begin to filter through the mob, still keeping pace. Sameer hands one to me before taking one for himself.<br> <br>My gut turns inside out, hollow. I look around for some way to get myself out of here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pa-ki-stan Zin-da-bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to get home!&#x201d; I yell so Sameer can hear me over the chanting.<br> <br>His face goes hard. &#x201c;No you don&#x2019;t, brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>The fellow on Sameer&#x2019;s other side, a giant of a man, with a heavy beard that makes him look even more threatening, leans around to give me a look. A look that dares me to say I need to go home again. I shut my mouth.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know where we&#x2019;re going, or what we&#x2019;re going to do when we get there, apart from the fact that it will be not be good. I&#x2019;ve been careful so far. Managed to avoid getting caught up in any of this violence. Allah&#x2019;s teeth! Why today of all days?<br> <br>Even if I could sneak away, I&#x2019;m as worried about what Sameer will think of me&#x2014;what he might say about me&#x2014;as I am about getting hurt in some brawling.<br> <br>This is no time to let loyalties be suspected.<br> <br>Some of the men with bats in their hands have taken to beating the tips against the ground in time with the chant. &#x201c;Pa-ki-stan Zin-da-bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>The lane widens, empties into a little cuanka. Across the way, moving in from the other street, another mob is moving in. Bigger than ours.<br> <br>My grip tightens, and I realize that this is it. I&#x2019;m going to have to go through with this, just to survive.<br> <br>But instead of clashing with the other mob, they take up our chant and we merge together, angling south across the square, which is empty now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pa-ki-stan Zin-da-bad.&#x201d; Some fifty voices chant together.<br> <br>We are heading for the gurdwara, I realize.<br> <br>The Sikh temple is not the only one in Jalandhar. It is not the biggest or grandest, either. A single small dome squats in the center of the roof, topped with the gilt khanda, the crossed swords glinting in the morning light. It is nothing fancy compared to the dozens of gurdwaras in town.<br> <br>But it is the only one that has no outer wall to protect it.<br> <br>There are still people inside. I can hear the prayers spilling out the windows.<br> <br>No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&#x2019;t do this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pa-ki-stan Zin-da-bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; Sameer presses close and asks me.<br> <br>No. I don&#x2019;t want to be here. I can&#x2019;t be here.<br> <br>But I manage to nod, even though I know I look as scared as I feel.<br> <br>Sameer leans around, forces me to look at him as we slow up. He lifts an eyebrow, shakes his head. The same shake he used to give me when we were kids and I wouldn&#x2019;t take him up on a dare.<br> <br>But he doesn&#x2019;t have time to say anything. The mob abandons the chant and rushes at the whitewashed sides of the building, screaming.<br> <br>And it begins.<br> <br>The building is burning before I even see that some of the men have been carrying cans of petrol. But there are people still in there! Maybe kids. Maybe women.<br> <br>It all happens too fast.<br> <br>Rocks sail through the windows; glass shatters inward. Rags soaked in oil and set alight find their way through the holes. But the people inside&#x2014;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a nightmare come to life.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know what to do.<br> <br>Sameer is gone, joining the attack. I should run now.<br> <br>Sikh men begin to pour from the building, chased out by the smoke. But as soon as they step outside, someone is there to make sure they don&#x2019;t get far.<br> <br>The bodies begin to pile up at the entrance without even making it to the street.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s nothing I can do to stop it. I don&#x2019;t know how to begin to stop it.<br> <br>The only thing I can do is run before I have to do anything to hurt any of them.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t see Sameer. If I go now, he&#x2019;d never know.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;ve barely taken a step when movement to my right catches my eye. A man, his white pagri already black with smoke, launches himself from one of the broken windows on the ground floor. The fight is centered toward the front of the building. No one is there to meet him when he comes out.<br> <br>But then he sees me. Me, standing there with a cricket bat outside his temple.<br> <br>He screams, brandishing a kirpan, the little sword flashing silver in the sunlight.<br> <br>He rushes at me, the knife tracking straight for my chest. I freeze, but I have to move. Move! Maybe I could knock it from his hand, knock him off balance, give myself time to get away. But what if I miss? What if my timing is off? But I have to try. So I lunge forward, swinging the bat like I have in matches a thousand times before. I swing as hard as I can for his arm. But to my horror I realize he&#x2019;s moving too fast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m going to miss his hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I can&#x2019;t stop.<br> <br>The end of the bat catches him square on the chin. Blood spits from his mouth as his head snaps sharply back.<br> <br>He drops at my feet, the knife falling from his slack hand.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t move for a second, the impact of the bat jarring through me like an aftershock, the crack of his jaw echoing in my ears. But I am still standing.<br> <br>The man is completely still. Allah, please, no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>He lies facedown in the dirt, blood running from his mouth and chin. No, no, no. I can&#x2019;t have killed him. Can&#x2019;t have. I only meant to keep him from killing me. I didn&#x2019;t mean to&#x2014;<br> <br>My stomach retches, and I bend forward, heave into the dirt. My hands are covered with a spray of blood&#x2014;his blood. I get sick again.<br> <br>Maybe he isn&#x2019;t dead, I tell myself. Maybe he&#x2019;ll wake up later. He would&#x2019;ve killed me. And as I think it, I realize someone still might.<br> <br>I straighten, look up quickly, and ready the bat in case someone else is coming at me. There are bodies all over the courtyard. A pile of them blocks off the front entrance, and the mob I came with has spread itself out, picking off the others coming out the windows now. I don&#x2019;t see any women. Or children. I don&#x2019;t know if it means they&#x2019;re all still trapped inside, or if they just weren&#x2019;t here today. I hope, I pray it&#x2019;s the latter.<br> <br>Just then Sameer sprints by with a couple of other men on their way to the back of the gurdwara, where more must be trying to escape. He catches my eye, glances down at the body at my feet, the bat in my hand, and raises his own bat in salute. He gestures for me to follow before disappearing around the side of the building.<br> <br>But I don&#x2019;t. I throw the bat down next to the man I hit&#x2014;the man who hasn&#x2019;t moved, hasn&#x2019;t even stirred. Then I turn and run.</p><h2>Sister Ignatia: Angel of Alcoholics Anonymous (A Campion Book)</h2><p>Sister Ignatia is the story of an exceptional woman, &#34;the little sister&#34; of Alcoholics Anonymous. Working with stock broker Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith, the founders of the A.A. movement, Sr. Ignatia arranged for the hospitalization of alcoholics at a time when alcoholism was seen as a weakness of character, rather than a disease. In St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, she began her crusade to aid those suffering from alcoholism and to help them become functioning and productive citizens once again. She was recognized by President John F. Kennedy for her pioneering contributions and was given the Theta Phi Alpha St. Catherine of Siena Award for outstanding Catholic women of national distinction.

She lives in New York City. </p>Half seafood cookbook and half family history, this volume's greatest strength is in the recipes for over 70 dishes that define New England summers-corn on the cob, salt-crusted shrimp, and lots of lobster-reproduced here in honor of Charles's family's summertime trips to Maine. Charles, owner and head chef of the widely hailed Pearl Oyster Bar in Manhattan, offers her hard-drinking, quick-learning adventures in the restaurant business in the memoir portion of the book, and though they will be nothing new to Kitchen Confidential fans, they make for a piquant prelude to her recipes. The book gets a little bogged down, however, in the chapters that detail early family trips to Maine. Although Charles's desire to tell her family's story is heartfelt, she often leaves out important details, such as dates and introductions to the characters, that would make the narrative easier to follow. The story alternates from intriguing family explorations (how did the author's family locate the one hotel in the Kennebunk region of Maine that accepted Jews in the 1920's?) to textbook historical notes that don't quite mesh with the personal tone. Readers will wonder, too, about such asides as when she mentions her one-time estrangement from both parents ("I discovered my father's death in the late 1980s quite by accident"). Still, when the focus is on the food that Charles loves, the book is an accessible and authoritative guide to seafood preparation, as Charles offers not only divine recipes, from Pearl Oyster Bar Cocktail Sauce to Blueberry Crumble Pie, but tips on selecting (never buy wet scallops), cleaning (leverage is the key to shucking oysters) and preparing (don't marinate fish much more than 30 minutes) all types of seafood.

He also shows how these sites and activities may become focal points of subversion and insurgency, as new means of communication vital for the smooth flow of capital also permit otherwise isolated and dispersed points of resistance to connect and combine with one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cutting through the smokescreen of high-tech propaganda, Dyer-Witheford predicts the advent of a reinvented, "autonomist" Marxism that will rediscover the possibility of a collective, communist transformation of society. Refuting the utopian promises of the information revolution, he discloses the real potentialities for a new social order in the form of a twenty-first-century communism based on the common sharing of wealth.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Nick Dyer-Witheford</b> is an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Western Ontario.<br> &nbsp;&#34;An outstanding survey of various forms of electronic and political activism that have challenged and even successfully subverted existing technologies; this information is worthy of a volume of its own. This book is a welcome antidote to the dominant voices of business and government, which claim that virtually every aspect of life must succumb to market forces. Dyer-Witheford succeeds in making complex ideas understandable without oversimplification.

Examining the end of life in the light of current psychological understanding, religious wisdom, and compassionate medical science, <em>The Grace of Dying</em> offers a fresh, deeply comforting message of hope and courage as we contemplate the meaning of our mortality.</p><p>While the prevailing Western medical tradition has seen death as an enemy to be fought and overcome, Singh offers a richer and more rewarding path of understanding. Combining extensive training and education in developmental psychology with profound spiritual insight, she balances expert analysis with moving accounts drawn from her experiences working with hundreds of dying patients at a large hospice.</p><p>Singh moves beyond the five stages of dying revealed in Kï¿½bler-Ross's classic <em>On Death and Dying, </em>and finds in the "nearing death experience" even more significant and forming stages of surrender and transcendence. These stages involve the qualities of grace: letting go, radiance, focusing inward, silence, a sense of the sacred, wisdom, intensity, and, in the end, a merging with Spirit. Through this intense process, we come to experience at last the reality of our true self, which transcends our finite ego and bodily existence, and our merging with the source of being from which we originated. Dying is safe.</p><p>In clear, nontechnical language, Singh reveals the transformations that come with dying, using the vocabulary of growing Western, as well as Eastern, wisdom.</p><p>Written for those aware that their life is coming to an end, those who care for the dying, and, ultimately, for all of us who inevitably face our owndeath and the deaths of the people we love, <em>The Grace in Dying</em> reveals that dying is the most transforming, powerful, and spiritually rich of life's experiences.</p></p><p>Right from the start Kathleen Dowling Singh proclaims: "Dying is safe. You are safe. Your loved one is safe. That is the message of all the words here." True to her promise, Dowling Singh walks us through the final stages of death with complete honesty, yet she manages to quell the ultimate fear of dying. Speaking of the "Nearing Death Experience," Singh has discovered a sequence of phases or qualities that signals when a dying person is entering the final stages of spiritual and psychological transformation. She names them as relaxation, withdrawal, radiance, interiority (a time of going inward), silence, sacred, transcendence, knowing, intensity, and perfection--all of which she explains in great detail. A hospice worker and worldwide lecturer, Dowling Singh is being touted as the next Kubler-Ross. Time will tell. One thing is for certain: this is an astonishingly intelligent and engrossing book about consciously surrendering our bodies and our egos to death. There are 500,000 hospice patients in the U.S. and 5 million hospice workers worldwide. And every one of them would probably find profound comfort in this breakthrough book on dying. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>&nbsp;Kathleen Dowling Singh, Ph.D., has extensive training and experience in both transpersonal psychology and many spiritual traditions.

It was not yet spring, the country roads muddy or still partly frozen. A weak sun appeared sporadically, sifting through the clouds, shining here and there for a few brief moments before disappearing again.</p> <p>A sharp wind whipped the edge of the blanket and Leif pulled it closer around him. He had no idea where he was, only that he traveled through a rolling countryside marked by occasional villages, on uneven roads lined with low walls made of stone. He had been in this land for more than four passings of the moon,though mayhap he had lost track of time.All he knew for certain was that his small ship had been dashed against a rocky shore somewhere north of here, carrying his nine companions to a watery grave and leaving his own body broken and battered.</p> <p>A shepherd had found him lying in the icy surf and had taken him in, nursing him through a burning fever. Leif had been barely among the living when traders came, paid the shepherd in silver coin and dragged Leif away.</p> <p>They wanted him because he looked different, because he <i>was</i> different than any of the men in this foreign land. He could not speak their language, nor understand a word of what they said, which seemed to amuse them and somehow enhance his worth. He was at least five inches taller than most of the men, his body far more muscular. Though some of them were blond, as he was, few wore beards, and none as long and shaggy as his. And their hair was cut short, while his grew past his shoulders.</p> <p>Leif had been weak, unable to defend himself, when he had been lifted into the back of a wagon and driven from the shepherd's hut. As his strength began to return, the people who had taken him began to fear him, and his legs and arms were shackled with bands of heavy iron. He was shoved into a cage not nearly big enough for a man of his size, forced to crouch in the straw on the floor like an animal.</p> <p>He was a prisoner in this hostile land, an oddity to be displayed to the people of the countryside, a cruel form of entertainment. They paid to see him, he knew. The fat man with a scar on his face who brought him food collected coins from the people who gathered around his cage. The man&#x2014;Snively, he was called&#x2014;beat and prodded him, goaded him into a violent temper, which seemed to please the crowd who had paid their money to see him.</p> <p>Leif hated the man. He hated all of them.</p> <p>Where he had lived, he was a free man, a man of rank among his people. His father had begged him not to leave the safety of his home, but Leif had been driven to see the world beyond his island. Since then, he had seen little outside his cage, and the hate and anger inside him gnawed like a hungry beast. Daily he prayed to the gods to help him escape, to give him strength until that time came. He promised himself it would happen, vowed he would make it so, and it was all that kept him sane.</p> <p>But day after day, no chance came and the despair inside him deepened. He felt as if he were becoming the animal they drove him to be, and only in death would he ever find peace.</p> <p>Leif fought the dark despair and clung to the faint hope that someday he would again be free.</p> <p><i>London, England 1842</i></p> <p>"I tell you, girl, it is time you did your duty!" The Earl of Hampton's knotted, veined hand slammed down on the table.</p> <p>Krista Hart jumped at the sound. "My duty? It is scarcely my <i>duty</i> to marry a man I cannot abide!" They were attending a ball at the Duke of Mansfield's town mansion. Through the library walls, she could hear the music of an eight-piece orchestra playing in the lavish mirrored ballroom upstairs.</p> <p>"What is wrong with Lord Albert?" A tall, silver-haired man, slightly stooped&#x2014;her grandfather&#x2014;fixed his pale blue eyes on her."He is young and not unattractive, the second son of the Marquess of Lindorf, a member of one of the most prominent families in England."</p> <p>"Lord Albert is a complete and utter toad. The man is vain and prissy and full of himself. He is conceited and not particularly intelligent, and I am not the least bit interested in marrying him."</p> <p>Her grandfather's wrinkled face turned red."Is there a man in the whole of London who would please you, Krista? I am beginning to believe there is not. It is your responsibility to provide me with a grandson to secure the line&#x2014;and time is slipping away!"</p> <p>"I know my duty, Grandfather. I have been told often enough." With no direct male heirs, by special writ of the late king the Hampton title could pass through the female side of the family to the first male offspring. After her mother had died, it became Krista's sworn duty, her family believed, to provide that heir. "I am not disinclined to marriage. It is just&#x2014;"</p> <p>"Just that you are too busy running that confounded<i> gazette </i>of yours." He said the word with a vehemence that matched the ruddy hue of his face. "Your father indulged your mother in her silly desire to work like a commoner, and now he is indulging you. No decent woman of our social class holds a<i> job, </i>for God's sake. Or associates with the lower elements, as you do in order to produce your ridiculous magazine."</p> <p>"<i>Heart to Heart</i> is not the least bit ridiculous. Our articles are educational as well as informative, and I am extremely proud of the work we do."</p> <p>He made a harrumphing sound. "Your blasted gazette aside, it is time you thought of the future, time you assumed your responsibilities as my only surviving offspring and gave me the heir I need."</p> <p>Krista walked toward him, the petticoats beneath the full skirt of her plum silk gown swishing against her legs as she approached where he stood next to the ornate table in the library. They'd had this conversation a number of times before&#x2014;always with the same result&#x2014;but she loved her grandfather and she didn't want to displease him.</p> <p>Leaning over, she kissed his pale cheek. "I want a husband and family nearly as much as you want me to have them, Grandfather, but I refuse to marry a man like Lord Albert. I am certain that in time I will meet the right man."</p> <p>And perhaps she already had. Last week she had made the acquaintance of a friend of her father's named Matthew Carlton. Matthew was an associate professor and the second son of the Earl of Lisemore, just the sort of man her family wanted her to wed, and Matthew had truly seemed interested in pursuing a relationship.</p> <p>Still, she didn't dare mention that fact to her grandfather for fear he would begin to pressure her and perhaps even Matthew.</p> <p>The earl looked her in the eye. "I don't want you to be unhappy. You understand that, don't you?"</p> <p>"I know. In time, it will surely work out." At least that was what she hoped. But she was different from other women of her social class: unfashionably taller, more buxom&#x2014;more independent. She didn't have a line of suitors waiting outside her door, and her grandfather knew it.</p> <p>"Time," he scoffed, "is something an old man like me does not have."</p> <p>She reached down and caught his thin hand. "That is not true. You are still quite robust&#x2014;do not deny it." But as she looked at him, there was no doubt he was aging, and if she didn't marry and begin a family soon, the title might&#x2014;as the earl so deeply feared&#x2014;be lost to some distant cousin.</p> <p>The old man sighed."You try my patience,girl,"he grumbled. "I am sorry, Grandfather. I am doing the best I can." Krista said no more and neither did he. Blowing him a kiss as she left the library, she made her way out the door toward the sound of gaiety in the ballroom, but she was no longer in the mood to dance and pretend to enjoy herself.</p> <p>Still, she had promised her grandfather and the hour was yet early. Making her way through the house in search of her father and her best friend, Coralee Whitmore, who had accompanied her to the ball, she thought of Matthew Carlton and wondered at the possibilities.</p> <p>Leif leaned back against the bars of his cage. In the distance, he could hear the odd, lyrical sounds of the machine that played music whenever the traveling company rolled into a village. The sun was out, warming him a little, but his cage was parked in a shady spot and an icy wind raised goose bumps over his bare skin. The only garment he wore was a spotted animal skin just large enough to cover his rod and the rest of his man parts. It did nothing to warm him.</p> <p>He looked out through the bars of his cage. In the past few weeks, he had lost track of how long he had been confined. Again and again, he had attacked the men who guarded him, fought like a madman for his freedom, but shackled and chained as he was, he'd had no real chance to escape.</p> <p>He reached down and plucked up a blade of straw from the damp mound covering the floor of his cage. He had wanted to see the world outside his homeland. He scoffed. He had seen any number of amazing things in this foreign land, seen animals unlike any he had known existed, seen houses larger than his entire village back home. There were people of different colors, of every shape and size. If he was not locked in this cage, he would be fascinated by the sights and places in this new and strange world, but instead, he remained a prisoner, locked up and treated like a beast.</p> <p>In the days since he had been taken captive, he had been laughed at, jeered at, stoned and beaten. The people thought he was mad, and some days he believed it, too. Worse were the ones who pitied him. He had seen women cry at the cruelties he suffered. He did not want their pity, but it made him think that mayhap all of the people in this world were not like the ones who had stolen his freedom. Mayhap one day he would find someone willing to help him. If only he could speak to them, make them understand.</p> <p>He said a silent prayer to the gods, as he did each day, begging them to help him.</p> <p>Mayhap one day they would. It might even be today. Leif clung to the thought as the crowd began to form around his cage.</p></p><h2>Poison Mind</h2><p>Doctors were baffled when warmhearted Peggy Carr was rushed to the hospital with fiery burning sensations.

What should a pastor do? What makes a pastor good or effective? What <em>is</em> a pastor, after all? Hundreds of books, tapes, workshops and seminars promise to answer these impossible questions. Some offer a set of practical guidelines; others suggest a system or pattern to follow. Some stress various ministry functions; others feature case studies as models of success or failure. Some are helpful. Others are not. But in <em>The Art of Pastoring,</em> David Hansen turns pastoral self-help programs on their heads. He tackles the perennial questions from within his own experience. <strong>From the Inside Out</strong> Hansen's fresh, bold narrative grows from nearly a decade of ministry. He draws you into his life and into the lives of Florence-Victor Parish in the mountains of Montana, including unforgettable encounters with unforgettable people--a stubborn pioneer woman who still chops her own firewood though she's blind and 90 years old, a championship rodeo cowboy who was baptized in his boots, and many more. Hansen's goal is to help you discover "that pastoral ministry is a life, not a technology . . . [that] life as a pastor is far more than the sum of the tasks I carry out. It is a call from God that involves my whole life." <strong>From Calling to Living Parable</strong> Every pastor has encountered those who struggle to hear God's voice in a hospital room, who reach for Jesus in the sacraments. No systematic answers can meet their deep, eternal needs. What can touch them, Hansen contends, is a life itself, a life lived as a parable of Jesus. "As a parable of Jesus Christ," Hansen writes, "I deliver something to the parishioner that I am not, and in the process I deliver the parishioner into the hands of God." It is this knack for getting to the heart of things that makes <em>The Art of Pastoring</em> valuable for pastors in any setting--rural, suburban or urban. Parachurch workers, missionaries, church leaders and ministry volunteers will also find inspiration here. Even if you haven't yet been involved in full-time ministry, Hansen's book will be eye-opening. You'll see your own pastor differently as a result. And you'll discover how you too can be a living parable of Jesus Christ in the lives of your family, coworkers, friends and neighbors.</p><p></p><h2>Absent in the Spring and Other Novels: Absent in the Spring; Giant&#39;s Bread; The Rose and the Yew Tree (Mary Westmacott Omnibus)</h2><p><p>First published between 1930 and 1956, the six novels written by Agatha Christie under the name Mary Westmacott, regarded by some as the writer's finest work, show a very different side of her talent. What they share with her other fiction is Christie's gift for sharp observations about people, the ambitions that drive them, their relationships, and the conflicts that erupt between them. This omnibus edition brings together three of Westmacott novels:</p><p><i>Absent in the Spring</i>: Stranded between trains, Joan Scudamore finds herself reflecting upon her life, her family, and finally coming to grips with the uncomfortable truths about her life.</p><p><i>Giant's Bread</i>: The story of Vernon Deyre, a composer and pianist whose obsession with art wreaks havoc with the two very different women in his life.</p><p><i>The Rose and the Yew Tree</i>: In one of the finest explorations of the human heart, the compelling story of a deep and abiding love, the conflicts it encompasses, and the price that must be paid.</p></p><p><p><b>Agatha Christie</b> is the best-selling author of all time. She wrote eighty crime novels and story collections, fourteen plays, and several other books. Her books have sold roughly four billion copies and have been translated into 45 languages. She is the creator of the two most enduring figures in crime literature&#x2015;Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple&#x2015;and author of <i>The Mousetrap</i>, the longest-running play in the history of modern theatre. Christie was born in Torquay, Devon in 1890. She died in 1976 in Wallingford, Oxfordshire.</p>For those truly unable to get enough of the perennial queen of mystery, St. Martin's has reissued Absent in the Spring, a collection of three novels by Agatha Christie writing under the pen name Mary Westmacott. The clipped prose and careful plotting are familiar, but daggers and blunt objects are replaced in this trio of psychological dramas by sofa cushions and tea sets. The title novel tells of a middle-class man haunted by a past liaison; Giant's Bread of a composer and pianist obsessed with art; and The Rose and the Yew Tree of a young woman tormented by love. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Timechart History of the World: Over 6000 Years of World History Unfolded (Timechart series)</h2><p>The timechart is based on an original Victorian wall chart, published in 1890.

Until, one winter, he finds himself back on the farm and begins to learn the ways of the farmer and the way of the cows. Connell records the hypnotic rhythm of the farming day - cleaning the outhouses, milking the herd, tending to sickly lambs, helping the cows give birth. But alongside the routine events, there are the unforeseen moments when things go wrong: when a calf fails to thrive, when a sheep goes missing, when illness breaks out, when depression takes hold, when an argument erupts and things are said that cannot be unsaid. The Cow Book is the story of a calving season. It is also the story of the cow itself, from its domestication and worship as a God by the Ancient Egyptians to the modern practice of mechanized herds, via the figure of the cowboy, the destruction of the American buffalo, the demise of the aboriginal jackaroos and the consequences of BSE. And, above all, it is the story of Connell&#39;s life as a farmer, of his relationship with his birthplace of County Longford, with the community around the family farm, with the animals he tends, and with his father.</p><p>John Connell was published in Granta&#39;s New Irish Writing issue, and has also had a story published on Granta.com. He lives on his family farm, Birchview, in County Longford, and this is his first book.</p><h2>The Kings of the Air: French Aces and Airmen of the Great War</h2><p>In comparison to their British and German counterparts, the French airmen of the Great War are not well known. Yet their aerial exploits were just as remarkable, and their contribution to the war effort on the Western Front was equally important. That is why Ian Sumner&#x2019;s vivid history of the men of the French air force during the war is of such value. He tells their story using the words of the pioneering pilots and observers themselves, drawn from memoirs, diaries, letters, and contemporary newspapers, magazines and official documents. The recollections of the airmen give an authentic portrait of their role and their wartime careers. They cover recruitment and training, reconnaissance and artillery spotting, aerial combat, ground strafing and bombing, and squadron life. They also highlight the technical and tactical innovations made during those hectic years, as well as revealing the airmen's attitude to the enemy - and their thoughts about the ever-present threat of injury and death.</p><p>Ian Sumner is a prolific writer and researcher who specializes in local and military history. He has made a particular study of the French army and air force during the First World War, his many books on the subject including The French Army 1914-18, French Poilu 1914-18, First Battle of the Marne 1914, They Shall Not Pass: The French Army on the Western Front 1914-1918, Kings of the Air: French Aces and Airmen of the Great War and The French Army at Verdun.</p><h2>Whistle</h2><p>Stated First Delacorte Press Edition.

He served in the U.S. Army from 1939 to 1944, and was present at the attack on Pearl Harbor as well as the battle for Guadalcanal, where he was decorated with a purple heart and bronze star. Jones&#x2019;s experiences informed his epic novels <i>From Here to Eternity</i> and <i>The Thin Red Line</i>. His other works include <i>Some Came Running</i>, <i>The Pistol</i>, <i>Go to the Widow-Maker</i>, <i>The Ice-Cream Headache and Other Stories</i>, <i>The Merry Month of May</i>, <i>A Touch of Danger</i>, <i>Whistle</i>, and<i> To the End of the War</i>&#x2014;a book of previously unpublished fiction.&#x201c;Jones was a powerful naturalistic chronicler of certain essential realities of warfare and of the responses of men at war.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Few men write as effectively about the American army as James Jones.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Newsweek</i><i>&nbsp;</i>&#x201c;The only one of my contemporaries who I felt had more talent than myself was James Jones.

As a collecting area it is in its infancy but contains all the ingredients a potential collector would choose. There is history, geography, economics, workmanship and engineering. There are makers&#39; marks and trademarks, common, scarce and rare varieties. There are collecting areas within areas and satisfying, attractive objects of varying sizes in various materials. From asparagus forks to water barrows and bark peeling spades to thistle tongs, this book includes details and illustrations to make the reader aware of a lesser known aspect of gardening history.</p><p>Alistair Morris is a Director of Sotheby&#39;s.Since many types of home furnishing antiques have now been depleted by collectors, one of the last fertile categories remaining is the garden and all its wares. With the publication of British auction expert Morris' catalog, however, few items will be found at bargain prices. Quite simply, this is a list of every implement, structure, or leisure activity intended for the residential out-of-doors; in many cases, the appropriate photograph or illustration has been lifted (with permission, of course) directly from a manufacturer's brochure. Descriptions of each are straightforward and without prices, but occasionally lightened by a representative painting or family photograph (Mrs. Dempster with her dogs being a priceless example). Once in a while, a bit of a snicker creeps in--as in his mention of the cucumber straightener and the existence of a real British Lawnmower Museum. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Kodocha: Sana&#39;s Stage, Book 9</h2><p>Seventh-grader Sana Kurata must deal with being a famous child actress while also coping with her family and school mates including bad-boy Hayama, fellow child star Naozumi, and best friend Fuka.</p><p></p><h2>Planet Plague (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 3)</h2><p>When Hoole decides to visit the planet Gobindi, even a warning from Tash's anonymous Holonet contact isn't enough to change his mind.

At the same time, many have discovered that there are serious problems associated with wood heat and iron stoves: chimney fires from creosote, air pollution from poor combustion, and structural fires caused by faulty stove installation. The masonry stove, widely used in Europe and Asia for centuries, surmounts these problems.</p> <p>Masonry stoves offer good solutions to many of the problems associated with wood burning. They provide clean combustion at a high temperature, good efficiency, a high degree of safety, and little or no pollution. Masonry stoves require little care, needing to be fed only once or twice a day. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes from simple to elegant and from austere to gothic. And they are easily adapted to a variety of structures including solar designs.</p> <p><em>The Book of Masonry Stoves</em> represents the first comprehensive survey ever published of all the major types of masonry heating systems, ancient and modern. Detailed plans and building information are included in the book. As a complete introduction to masonry stoves, it will help many people rediscover an old way of warming, using masonry stoves.</p></p><p><p>David Lyle, one of the best-informed people in the U.S. in the wood heat field, has tested a great variety of stoves during the past 30 years. For several years, he was the national distributor of Lange stoves in the U.S. In addition to his professional work with wood-burning stoves, Mr. Lyle has heated his own home with wood for several decades. Readers may recognize David Lyle as a former writer for the <em>New York Herald Tribune</em>, and the <em>Associated Press</em>. His articles have also appeared in <em>Esquire, Fine Homebuilding</em>, and other magazines. He lives in Acworth, New Hampshire, where he credits his special knowledge of chimney fires to his experience with the Acworth Volunteer Fire Company.</p><p>"More than a mere manual, <em>The Book of Masonry Stoves</em> is a fascinating study of the history of fire through the ages. It's also a convincing argument for the efficiency, safety, and comfort of masonry."<strong>--Susan Renner-Sinith,</strong> <em><strong>Popular Science Magazine</strong></em></p><br><br><p>"It's hard to believe that anyone knows more about wood heating--let alone masonry stoves--than David Lvle, who has made it a consuming avocation and profession for many years.

Her &#39;Old bear&#39; series of books won worldwide acclaim and featured in a BAFTA award winning TV series. Jane has three grown up children and lives in Sussex, with her husband Ivan, who is also an illustrator.Using the appealing cast of stuffed animals that she introduced in Old Bear (1986) author/illustrator Hissey creates a sweet, old-fashioned tale about a little dog who finds a home. When Old Bear and the others hear a strange barking noise coming from the garden, they discover a little dog who has neither name nor home. The poor thing has never even had a birthday. So Old Bear and his pals set about righting the wrongs, giving the little stranger- -now called Ruff--a birthday party every day for a week to make up for all the birthdays he never had. The parties are such fun, and his new friends so nice, that Ruff hates to see the week come to an end. But to his surprise, the animals open their paws and hearts, and Ruff has a home at last. Ruff's adventures are rendered in Hissey's distinctive style, which uses a vivid palette and carefully delineated drawings to illustrate the toys and settings of some idyllic time before the onslaught of plastic, glitter, and electronic voices transformed kids' toys--and lives--forever. An engaging, warmhearted tale in which the delicious, nostalgic illustrations are the chief delight. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The crash of an extraterrestrial flying saucer will, perhaps, change that. This masterfully crafted, witty and irreverent graphic novel is Argentine cartoonist and graphic designer Lucas Varela's debut. Full-color illustrations throughout</p><p>Lucas Varela is an Argentine cartoonist, graphic designer, and illustrator. After graduating from the University of Buenos Aires, he worked for Argentina&#x2019;s largest newspaper, Clarin, and co-founded the&nbsp;comics zine Kapop.He currently lives in Angouleme, France, where he is serving as an artist in residence at La Maison Des Auteur.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;In a city divided by two warring companies, with citizens pledging brand allegiance to the dress, mascots, and products of one or the other, two opposing plans of violent corporate espionage are complicated by the crash landing of an extraterrestrial craft. Using no dialogue, only the occasional sound effect or scream, Varela presents a series of interconnected vignettes involving each of the various players, forcing readers to find context and information in the visuals. Color becomes incredibly important in decoding both the tone and the plot, and readers' progressive grasp of connections will build enjoyment. And there is much to appreciate, especially for those fond of absurdist violence, creepy dream sequences, and existential futility, all of which abound, as every page contains either a small character moment or a quick gag to advance the ever-accumulating story. This, combined with the intricate world design, makes for a book packed with invention, action, and discovery, even if some of the events are quite dark. The first scene involves a character contemplating suicide, and a later mild topless interlude quickly becomes as unerotic as is imaginable. The violence is never realistic, managing to be both extreme and comic. And, ultimately, no one is really victorious, which solidifies the consumerist satire and leaves readers appropriately discomfited.

In teaching writers the fundamentals of creating characters that will keep their readers spellbound, Kress utilizes: * Dozens of excerpts from well-known fiction * Enlightening exercises to help writers build strong characters starting from the outside-in * Beginning chapters that focus on the physical elements that comprise a character, providing techniques for using external qualities to reflect personality Building skill upon skill, writers blend these qualities with emotional and mental characterization, forming multidimensional characters that initiate exciting action, react to tense situations and power the plot from beginning to end.</p><p>Nancy Kress is the author of a number of books of fiction, which have won many awards.</p><h2>Collision course: The classic story of the most extraordinary sea disaster of our times--the collision at sea of the S.S. Andrea Doria and the M.S. Stockholm</h2><p>How the Stockholm and the Andrea Doria met in one of history's deadliest collisions.<br></p><p>In 1956, two luxury liners&#x2014;the MS Stockholm and the SS Andrea Doria&#x2014;equipped with every known safety device, collided off Long Island. The Stockholm was able to limp back to New York City, but the beautiful Andrea Doria, pride of the Italian Line, slipped slowly into the depths of the North Atlantic shortly after. Half a century later, the mystery of their convergence continues to fascinate readers and experts alike, right down to the stories of hidden treasures worth millions awaiting discovery deep in the Doria&#x2019;s decaying hull.<br>In Collision Course, author Alvin Moscow vividly re-creates the horror and magnitude of the catastrophe that struck the passengers and crews of both ships with such compelling realism that the reader relives the terror and confusion. The collision itself still baffles maritime experts and laymen alike by its enormity and utter improbability: that the two enormous ships, sailing in opposite directions on a calm sea, could converge at the same time and the same place. Moscow attended the four-month court hearings that sought to find the causes of the disaster, and reviewed six thousand pages of testimony and exhibits, interviewing all the principals to discover what actually happened that fateful night. Collision Course is an engrossing tale of human fallibility, and a must-read for any maritime history buff.<br><br>Alvin Moscow worked as a journalist for the <i>New York Times</i> and the Associated Press, where he covered the court hearings that sought to determine the cause of the crash of two ocean liners, the <i>Andrea Doria</i> and the <i>Stockholm</i>&#x2014;the subject of his critically acclaimed<i> New York Times&#x2013;</i>bestselling book<i> Collision Course</i>.

Starting from the idea that everyone has an innate ability to become sexually aroused, but sexuality has to be learned, the authors encourage first-hand experience right from the outset, and advise young people on how to recognise their own feelings, desires and boundaries and those of their partners in a context of tenderness, safety and fun. According to the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, half of all UK teenagers have their first sexual experience by age 14, but most are lacking in the knowledge and information that would allow them to navigate safely this exciting part of their lives. Sex &amp; Lovers exposes the deceits of pornography and talks about common fears and pressure to perform. With an engaging text, it poses and answers a host of questions with honesty: is there more than one way to masturbate? How do I recognise STDs? Does the withdrawal method work? What does sperm taste like? Are my breasts normal? Does it mean my partner doesn't care when he falls asleep after sex? And many, many more. Specially commissioned photographs show real couples having real sex. What comes across in these authentic images is a powerful sense of the closeness and intimacy of sexual partnership, the opposite of the voyeuristic images purveyed by pornography. Elegantly designed graphics, integrated with the text, cover many topics from reproductive biology to modern fashions in shaving body hair.</p><p>Ann-Marlene Henning (b.1964, Denmark) studied neuro-psychology and sexology.

Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.&gt;</p><p>A widely influential work from one of the last century&#39;s most important thinkers, this is a profound attack on the materialism of contemporary society.Born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Erich Fromm (1900-1980) studied sociology and psychoanalysis. In 1933, he emigrated as a member of the Frankfurt School of social thinkers to the United States, moved to Mexico in 1950, and spent his twilight years between 1974 and 1980 in Switzerland. His books Fear of Freedom (1941) and The Art of Loving (1956) made him famous.

In this book you can learn how to capture these inspiring images in watercolors. Firstly, you can hear me cheering when I read that Mr Bellamy suggests buying student quality paints is a good plan for anybody starting out or practising. That is after all what they are for (there is a big clue in the name) and here is one of the very few art instruction primer writers to agree with me. This sets the tone for a sensible, realistic book that does not advocate buying everything in the store and which has good advice for outdoor sketching as well as working from photographs. I particularly like the two paintings showing how not to lay out a landscape, and what constitutes a well constructed picture. There are sections on how to draw the elements that make up this type of painting, from rocky textures to animals and human figures, trees, water and skies. As actually having a go is the best way to learn there are also several projects to work through, with step-by-step pictures with captions showing how the painting is built up and how to do the various effects. I enjoyed the way that such a daunting subject was broken up into manageable elements, with plenty of instruction on how to achieve them along the way.

His style ranged from the social realism of his WPA murals through his abstract expressionist canvasses of the 1950s and 1960s (when he counted Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Kline among his friends) to his cartoonlike paintings of Klansmen, disembodied heads, and tangled piles of everyday objects. Critics and public alike savaged Guston for his return to figurative art, but today his late work is recognized for the singular power of his personal, darkly hilarious vision. Musa Mayer augments her firsthand knowledge with extensive interviews with his family, friends, students, and colleagues, as well as Guston&#39;s own letters, notes, and autobiographical writings, to re-create a turbulent era in American art. Night Studio, profusely illustrated (including almost a dozen paintings in full color), illuminates not only the life of a great artist, but the experience of growing up in his overwhelming shadow.<b>Musa Mayer</b> is the author of <i>Examining Myself: One Woman's Story of Breast Cancer Treatment and Recovery.</i> She lives in New York City.</p><h2>Project of Autonomy: Politics and Architecture Within and Against Capitalism</h2><p><em>The Project of Autonomy</em> radically readdresses the concept of autonomy in politics and architecture by tracing a concise and polemical argument about its history in Italy in the 1960s and early 1970s. Architect and educator Pier Vittorio Aureli analyzes the position of the Operaism movement and its intersections with two of the most radical architectural-urban theories of the day: Aldo Rossi's redefinition of the architecture of the city and Archizoom's No-stop City. The book draws on significant new source material, including recent interviews by the author and untranslated documents.</p><p>Pier Vittorio Aureli is an architect and educator. His theoretical studies focus on the relationship between architectural form, political thinking, and urban history. Aureli teaches at the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam and the Technical University of Delft and has been a visiting professor at the Architectural Association in London and Columbia s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. He is a frequent contributor to Log magazine and a cofounder of Dogma, an architectural collective that recently won first prize in an international competition for a new city for 500,000 inhabitants in South Korea.</p><h2>Faster Than the Speed of Light: The Story of a Scientific Speculation</h2><p>Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, and light travels at one fixed speed. This idea is considered a foundation of modern physics, but what if it is wrong?Theoretical physicist Magueijo presents the idea that light traveled faster in the early universe than it does today. The varying speed of light theory solves some of the most intractable problems in cosmology, and could have major implications for the study of physics.</p><p>Among physicists, it is widely assumed that one's greatest chance for a breakthrough discovery will come before one reaches the age of 30. True or not, this idea leads young physicists such as Joï¿½o Magueijo to pull out all the intellectual stops in the search for glory and immortality. In <i>Faster Than the Speed of Light</i>, Magueijo reveals the short, brilliant history of his possibly groundbreaking speculation--VSL, or Variable Light Speed. This notion--that the speed of light changed as the universe expanded after the Big Bang--contradicts no less prominent a figure than Albert Einstein. Because of this, Magueijo has suffered more than a few slings and arrows from hidebound, jealous, or perplexed colleagues. But the young scientist persisted, found a few important allies, and finally managed to shake up the establishment enough to get the attention he merited and craved. Magueijo begins the book with a suitably accessible explanation of special and general relativity, then moves on to the ideas that laid the groundwork for VSL. In the process, he rips the doors off of scientific academia and airs quite a bit of dirty laundry. Comparing himself to Einstein throughout the book, Magueijo approaches his topic and its dissemination with cocksure genius, expecting readers to sympathize with him as he battles to win favor. And we do. The scientific process is "rigorous, competitive, emotional, and argumentative," writes Magueijo. His theory could knock down two solid pillars of cosmology--inflation and relativity. Not only does his radical notion deserve a trial by fire, it also deserves a champion like Magueijo, who isn't afraid of the flames. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Joï¿½o Magueijo</b> is a lecturer in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College, London, where he was for three years a Royal Society Research Fellow.

Wolfe is planning an expedition to New Zealand to track a giant squid, and he's rented a huge (and possibly haunted) freighter for the trip. But someone on board is determined to sabotage their mission--and if Marty and Grace keeping poking their noses into things, they might end up the saboteur's next victims!</p><p>Roland Smith first worked with animals at the Portland Zoo, and he has been involved in animal rescues and conservation work around the world for more than twenty years. He is the author of numerous books for young readers, including JACK&#39;S RUN, ZACH&#39;S LIE, CRYPTID HUNTERS, PEAK, TENTACLES, and the Storm Runners series. He is also the co-author of numerous picture books with his wife, Marie. Roland lives with Marie on a farm south of Portland, Oregon. You can find him online at www.rolandsmith.com.Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Since the disappearance of Marty's parents, he and his cousin Grace have lived with her father, the renowned cryptozoologist Travis Wolfe. This sequel to <i>Cryptid Hunters</i> (Hyperion, 2005) begins with Wolfe mounting an expedition in search of a mythological giant squid. Marty, his friend Luther, and Grace join the crew aboard the <i>Coelacanth</i>, a refitted freighter. Unknown to Wolfe, however, his archenemy Noah Blackwood is in hot pursuit, determined to steal the gigantic creature and destroy Wolfe and his reputation. Add hatching dinosaur eggs, a manic chimpanzee, cool gadgets, a nifty undersea nuclear submarine, ruthless villains, murder, and sabotage to the mix and you've got a high-octane page-turner that will reel readers in and keep them riveted. Several unanswered questions suggest another sequel may be in the works, which will make Smith's fans very happy.&#x2014;<i>Jane Henriksen Baird, Anchorage Public Library, AK</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this Third Roxbury Edition, Kalberg offers a precise and nuanced rendering of The Protestant Ethic that captures Weber&#x2019;s style as well as the unusual subtlety of his descriptions and causal arguments. Kalberg&#x2019;s standardization of Weber&#x2019;s terminology facilitates understanding of the various twists and turns in his complex lines of reasoning. Weber&#x2019;s original italicization, highlighting major themes, has been restored. A glossary of major terms and numerous clarifying endnotes have been added; foreign terms have been translated; bracketed insertions in the text identify obscure names. In short, the Protestant Ethic thesis is presented in a clear and highly readable manner.</p><p> </p><p>There are three compelling reasons for students to read this classic:<br> </p><p>It explores the continuing debate regarding the origins and legacy of modern capitalism in the West.<br> It helps the reader better understand economic development today around the world, especially in Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America.<br> It plumbs the deep cultural forces that affect contemporary work life and the workplace in the United States and Europe. </p><p> In his introduction, Kalberg offers a sketch of Weber&#x2019;s life and his major concerns, examines the intellectual context at the time The Protestant Ethic was written, and summarizes major aspects of Weber&#x2019;s complex analysis. Kalberg also discusses this classical study in the context of Weber&#x2019;s other writings. Finally, Kalberg investigates the contribution of The Protestant Ethic for understanding the role played by cultural forces in modern economic development. </p><p> The new translation includes Weber&#x2019;s 1906 essay "The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism." Written after his extensive travels in the United States in 1904, Weber comments here on the diverse ways in which the legacies of early American Protestantism remain influential. Also contained in this edition are Weber&#x2019;s masterful prefatory remarks to his Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion, in which he defines the uniqueness of Western societies and asks what "ideas and interests" combined to call forth modern Western rationalism. </p><p> For students, The Protestant Ethic is a starting point toward understanding the multiple dimensions of social change. The continuing debates about the main elements of modern life, economic cultures and business ethics, our "common sense" economic determinism and "rational choices," the future of modern capitalism, the relationship between cultural forces and social structures, and the tension between science and religion are very much part of the Weberian project. Small wonder, then, that The Protestant Ethic continues to be one of the most frequently assigned readings in sociology. </p><p> Translator Stephen Kalberg is the author of Max Weber&#x2019;s Comparative-Historical Sociology (1994), Max Weber&#x2019;s Sociology of Civilizations, and numerous articles on Weber. He is the editor of Max Weber: The Confrontation with Modernity (2003l). He teaches at Boston University, where he is Associate Professor of Sociology. He is also co-chair of the German Study Group at Harvard University's Center for European Studies.</p></p><p>This is the third printing of the Roxbury Third Edition (June, 2002). A number of printer&#x2019;s errors have been corrected. Three passages that included translation errors have been revised.Throughout my work on this new translation I have been the fortunate recipient of a completely unexpected outpouring of generosity from friends, colleagues, and specialists. It has far exceeded any claims for assistance that a translator might reasonably expect, and it has sustained me. Robert J. Antonio, Ira J. Cohen, Lyn Macgregor, and Michael Moody read an entire early draft of the text and offered comments that altered the direction of my work. My bicultural assistant, Jessica Horst, tirelessly tracked down dozens of references in Boston-area libraries and on the Internet. Ulrich Nanko, a theologian in Stuttgart, located innumerable obscure persons and documents in the best German encyclopedias. John Drysdale, a native speaker of English, closely evaluated the entire translation; his suggestions were always beneficial and almost always accepted. Finally, I owe my greatest debt to Michael Kaern, a native speaker of German who checked the translation line by line. He unfailingly answered my many questions, large and small, and counseled on a daily basis with patience, insight, and high generosity of spirit. He did so, as we debated the merits of various English translations for technical terms, on the basis of an intimate knowledge of the world inhabited by German scholars 100 years ago. I am grateful to all. They have improved this translation far beyond what it otherwise would have been.</p><h2>Eat Your Yard: Edible Trees, Shrubs, Vines, Herbs, and Flowers For Your Landscape</h2><p><p> </p> <p><strong>Eat Your Yard!</strong> has information on 35 edible plants that offer the best of both landscape and culinary uses.

Two extra-large mixing bowls of fruit, about 15 to 18 pounds, yields 12 to 16 half-pints.</li> <li>Rinse the crabapples in batches, leaving plenty of stems. Halve the fruit, place in a heavy enameled pot, and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until fruit is soft and the liquid is lightly colored, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and strain through a cheesecloth-lined sieve into a clean bowl. Do not squeeze or press the pulp, as this clouds the jelly. Let the final batches sit overnight so all the juice can drip through.</li> <li>The next day, wash and scald canning jars, new lids, bands, and utensils, including a wide-mouth funnel. Measure the juice, up to 8 cups per batch. Bring juice to a rapid boil in a large enameled pot for 5 minutes, removing any froth that forms; at the same time prepare a water bath in a separate kettle for sealing the jars.</li> <li>Add 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar for each cup of juice. Dissolve sugar in the boiling juice, and continue to boil until the mixture reaches the jelling point. Test for this by pouring a small quantity of the mixture off the side of a wide cooking spoon; when it slows and forms a sheet rather than individual drops, the jelly is ready, usually about 15 minutes.</li> <li>Pour carefully into jars, leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch headroom, gently cover with lids and bands, and seal in a boiling hot water bath for 20 minutes.</li> </ul></p><p><p>Eat Your Yard! </p> <p>Edible trees, shrubs, vines, herbs and flowers for your landscape </p> <p></p> <p>Eat Your Yard! proves that you can have your beautiful landscape and eat it too!

In this volume, Lacey limns the most important period in England&#39;s past, highlighting the spread of the English language, the rejection of both a religion and a traditional view of kingly authority, and an unstoppable movement toward intellectual and political freedom from 1387 to 1689. Opening with Chaucer&#39;s Canterbury Tales and culminating in William and Mary&#39;s &#34;Glorious Revolution,&#34; Lacey revisits some of the truly classic stories of English history: the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V&#39;s skilled archers defeated a French army three times as large; the tragic tale of the two young princes locked in the Tower of London (and almost certainly murdered) by their usurping uncle, Richard III; Henry VIII&#39;s schismatic divorce, not just from his wife but from the authority of the Catholic Church; &#34;Bloody Mary&#34; and the burning of religious dissidents; Sir Francis Drake&#39;s dramatic, if questionable, part in the defeat of the Spanish Armada; and the terrible and transformative Great Fire of London, to name but a few. Here Anglophiles will find their favorite English kings and queens, villains and victims, authors and architects - from Richard II to Anne Boleyn, the Virgin Queen to Oliver Cromwell, Samuel Pepys to Christopher Wren, and many more. Continuing the &#34;eminently readable, highly enjoyable&#34; (St. Louis Post-Dispatch) history he began in volume I of Great Tales from English History, Robert Lacey has drawn on the most up-to-date research to present a taut and riveting narrative, breathing life into the most pivotal characters and exciting landmarks in England&#39;s history.</p><p>Robert Lacey is the coauthor of the history classic The Year 1000, and the author of such bestselling books as Majesty, The Kingdom, Ford: The Men and the Machine, Sotheby&#x2019;s: Bidding for Class, and The Queen Mother&#x2019;s Century. He lives in London.Acclaimed historian Lacey's second volume on English history opens in 1348, the year of the Black Plague, which wiped out half of England's five million people, and proceeds through the astonishing scientific discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton in 1687. Along the way, we meet characters as diverse as Chaucer, Richard II, Henry IV, William Caxton, Guy Fawkes, Richard Whittington, Lady Jane Grey and Titus Oates. In lively vignettes, Lacey (<i>The Year 1000</i>; <i>Majesty</i>) also regales us with such events as the Puritan civil war, the London fire of 1666 and Sir Walter Raleigh's voyages to the New World. Political and religious dissent dominate these tales. Lacey captures the humor inherent in the evolution of England's history; thus, he includes the story of the first modern water closet, invented by Queen Elizabeth's godson, Sir John Harrington. In addition, Lacey briefly chronicles the British attraction to the rare and the exotic in the tale of John Tradescant's opening to the public in the 1630s of his collection of artifacts and curiosities&#x2014;England's "first museum." Lacey's animated prose, energetic storytelling and spirited approach to British history bring the past to life. 51 b&amp;w illus., 2 maps. <i>(June 2)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set in teeming, corrupt Buenos Aires in the watershed year of 1973, it creates a portrait of a city, a culture and the tortured soul of a man who dares to look truth in the face.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SpanishA dense and often leaden novel by Argentinean writer Sabato (On Heroes and Tombs, 1981) that comes to life--and that only momentarily--in the last 40 or so pages. Ponderously cerebral, the story is essentially an examination of the increasing pervasiveness of evil. Set in Buenos Aires in the early 1970's at the height of the military dictatorship--when innocent young men were imprisoned, tortured and then ``disappeared'' without a trace--Sabato has more than enough material for this tale of a labyrinthine conspiracy of evil spreading through the city like an infection. The author himself is a character, not the author as a figure as in metafiction but as ``just another character, the same sort of character as all the rest, which however do come from the soul or spirit of anima of the author. The author would be a man maddened, somehow, and living with his own doubles, aspects of his own self.'' Accordingly, while S., the writer, follows a mysterious Dr. Schneider (who might be a former Nazi), is accused by a young idealist of selling out, and searches for a society of the blind rumored to be responsible for all that is wrong, a drunkard across town sees fiery dragons in the sky; a young man is tortured and killed for his beliefs; and, in the salons and bars alike, unease and despair are rife. These disparate parts abruptly all come together, and S. and Sabato find comfort in the notion of peace--``a melancholy restfulness that a child feels when he lays his head in his mother's lap and closes his eyes still filled with tears, after the terrors of a nightmare.'' Some interesting insights and searing accounts of torture, but these are so deeply mired in self-conscious intellectualism that their impact is soon lost.

While in New York City working as a magazine illustrator he began writing his first novel, The Ipcress File, which was published in 1962. He is now the author of more than thirty books of fiction and non-fiction. At present living in Europe, he has, over the years, lived with his family in ten different countries from Austria to Portugal.Abandoning present-day intrigues (MAMista, Spy Sinker, etc.), Deighton journeys back to WW II (SS-GB and XPD)--and a terrific return it is: a rich drama of heroes and villains awaiting German General Erwin Rommel's attack on Cairo--the ``city of gold.'' The plots here are many, but central among them is the attempt by Special Investigation Branch Major Bert Cutler to unmask the spy who's been leaking British secrets to Rommel. The kicker is that Cutler isn't Cutler; he's really Jimmy Ross, a British corporal who was on his way to Cairo to be court-martialed for killing an officer when his escort, Cutler, keeled over from a heart attack. Quick-thinking Ross switched IDs with Cutler and now finds himself in Cairo with an office, full staff, and carte blanche to turn the city upside down in pursuit of the spy--that is, if he doesn't betray himself first to any of the marvelously realized characters who crowd the pages here, from his leathery assistant to a manipulative Jewish nationalist, a White Russian prince, two young and beautiful Englishwomen, an upper-class British deserter turned grand thief, a too-caricatured American reporter (all tough pose and cocky action), and King Farouk himself--fat, decadent, imperious. It's the deserter who--by committing a murder that Ross must investigate--turns out to be Ross's main foil; and it's he who pulls the narrative--the first half of which springs forward mostly on perfectly pitched dialogue--into the desert and shattering action as Rommel attacks an armored caravan carrying Ross and several others, precipitating a crisis that movingly strips these men, good and evil, down to their bare selves. At one point, Ross is likened to Bogart--appropriate in a novel so reminiscent in spirit to Casablanca. And if this is the same old story, a song of love and glory, at least it's told here with consummate skill. Play it again, Len. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Maxwell</h2><p>Compassionate, witty, politically astute, and spiritually authentic, Neal Maxwell has always been passionately engaged in life&#39;s battles. This instinct for action impelled him into the infantry in World War II where, on Okinawa, shaking and crying in a foxhole full of mud and foul water, he pledged his life to the Lord and was miraculously spared. An Apostle since 1981, Elder Maxwell has engaged a broader struggle, that between the sacred and the secular, the tension between faith and reason, and finally his greatest cause his spiritual ministry. His eloquent defense of Christianity and his brilliant reconciliation of faith and intellect are a rich legacy. But beyond that, he has shown that with the Savior&#39;s help, ordinary people can be better, less competitive, more loving, and receive the soul-transforming gift of charity. In this inspiring, sometimes humorous, and moving biography, Elder Bruce C. Hafen has painted an intimate portrait of a beloved Apostle, capturing the warm, personal stories that reveal the heart and mind of a true disciple of Christ.</p><p></p><h2>The 10 Greatest Gifts I Give My Children: Parenting from the Heart</h2><p>The twentieth anniversary edition of the classic parenting book, now updated to reflect Steven Vannoy&#x2019;s two decades of experience helping both families and businesses better care for their children and employees.<b></b><br><br>For more than twenty years, <i>The 10 Greatest Gifts I Give My Children</i> has been helping parents to put the joy back into parenting.

Their driving seems very erratic. Then I pull alongside and notice that while they appeared to be looking straight ahead, they were actually driving by looking in the rearview mirror. Some are checking their hair, applying makeup, shaving -- whatever -- and some are just staring in the mirror for no apparent reason.<br><br>A lot of families I know, including my own for many years, steer their lives the way these drivers do their cars -- by staring in the rearview mirror!<br><br>We only have a certain amount of energy, time, and potential to use each day. Of the 100 percent we have, only we can choose where to focus it. And while at times it may look as if we're moving forward, most of us are really aiming backward -- back at all our accumulated problems, what didn't work, what went wrong, who else's fault it was, why we can't get where we want to go.<br><br>Meanwhile, the families that are really going forward look forward, with only a brief glance back now and then to gain perspective and remember what worked before so they can do more of it.<br><br>It reminds me of five-year-old Jeremy's question: "Mom," he asked in a restaurant one day, "what's history?" His mom, Diane, gave him a lengthy discourse, drawing on her extensive college education.<br><br>"I could see by his blank stare this was not getting through," Diane said. "I asked him where he had heard it used."<br><br>"The waitress over there just dropped a fork and said 'Well, that's history,'" he replied.<br><br>The waitress had the proper perspective. She could have focused on how clumsy she was, what a problem it was that she would have to get a clean fork, how it disrupted her work. That kind of thinking would have lowered her self-esteem and diminished her joy and energy, but she let it just go as "history." Instead of reinforcing the thought that this was going to be "another one of those days," she instead turned her attention to moving forward.<br><br>Can we actually choose how to focus our minds and energy so that we keep moving forward? Absolutely! Let's start with three simple principles of how our minds work.<br><br><b>First: We can only focus on one thing at a time.</b> When someone thinks he's simultaneously watching television, reading a magazine and talking on the phone he's fooling himself. Research shows that he is actually switching his attention back and forth from one thing to another. Dentists have discovered how patients listening to music through headphones experience less discomfort because they're focusing on the music rather than what's going on in their mouth. We all know how easily a child can be distracted from an upset with a hug or a kiss or a toy because he or she can only focus on one thing at a time.<br><br><b>Second: We can't avoid a "don't."</b> Imagine I'm standing in front of you fight now and I suddenly hold up a sign that reads: "Don't look at my shoes." Where are your eyes going to go immediately? You guessed it! You might have tremendous willpower and be able to stop your eyes before they drift all the way down to my feet, but the urge will be mighty strong to catch a glimpse of my shoes. This is because our minds have to imagine doing something before we can tell ourselves to do it or not to do it.<br><br>It took me a long time to realize that when I told my daughter not to spill her milk, she had to visualize actually spilling her milk before she could understand my words. If I tell her not to hit her sister, guess what I've done? If you think I've just presented her with a prime target, you're absolutely right.<br><br><b>Third: We go toward what we focus on.</b> Have you ever watched a pothole as you drove down the road and found that's exactly what you steered into? Or started watching the white line along the highway at night and found you were soon straddling it instead of driving in your lane? Horseback riders know a horse will go wherever its <i>rider</i> is looking.<br><br>I remember the last time I went hang gliding. As I soared off the mountain cliff, a huge, soft-looking meadow spread below me. Only one tree interrupted its vast emptiness. Just one tree. Only one tree. A fascinating tree. I couldn't get my mind off that tree. Guess where I landed?<br><br>Which child is likely to do better in a softball game -- the one who's focusing on the ball or the one who's trying to remember where to put her feet or how to hold her arms or grip the bat?<br><br>These three factors describing how our minds work are so apparent now that I think back to how we used to struggle with my daughter Emmy's "shyness."<br><br><i>When Emmy was five, she was painfully shy. I introduced her as my "shy child" and other people would comment on how shy she was. Since we go toward what we focus on, of course, all she did was become more shy. I'd say, "Emmy, don't be shy," but since we can't avoid a don't, guess which direction her shy quotient zoomed?<br><br>The difference in her was like night and day once I learned to adjust my own focus as well as hers. If she said "hello" to someone, no matter how timidly, I focused on her greeting and complimented her on it. (This is a process we work on in "10 Greatest Gifts" seminars called FAC -- Find, Acknowledge, Celebrate!) If she shook someone's hand or looked them in the eye, I noticed that behavior and gave her lots of positive messages about it.<br><br>In just a few months she became one of the most outgoing, sociable little girls I know. And many other people know and enjoy her as well, since shyness no longer holds her back.</i><br><br>Each of us has a 100 percent portion of personal and family energy to use every day. Where we focus that energy makes or breaks our day and takes us either several steps back into the mess we're struggling to get out of or many steps forward to where we want to go.<br><br>On the opposite page is an illustration listing the choices we have every day on where to focus our attention and energy.<br><br>We make choices every day. We can focus on what's not working (the left, back side) or we can focus on what's working. Since we can only focus on one thing at a time and since we go toward what we focus on, where would you rather focus? Most people say "on what's working," but where do most people and businesses usually direct their attention?<br><br>Would you rather focus on all the reasons you (or your family or your club or your company) can't get the outcome you want, or would you rather head toward the results you want to create? Do you know someone who, when faced with a new idea or solution, can think of at least a dozen reasons why it won't work? I'll bet you know many because, sadly, that's the norm in our society.<br><br>When we're operating on the back side of the energy circle, we're stuck on the problem, on what's not working, on all the reasons we can't get where we want to be. We look for who else is to blame so we can justify why we're poor, helpless victims. Since we can only focus on one thing at a time, when we're on that side of the energy circle, we are indeed stuck there. Remember we can only be on one side or the other.<br><br>When we refocus our energy and move into the forward side, we concentrate on what's working, what the solution is, the results we want to create and what we can do to move toward where we want to be.<br><br>It's a simple reality of life -- what you focus on is where you'll go. Focus on your problems, and they'll loom larger every day. Focus on solutions, and the problems begin to fade away. Focus on what uproar your household is always in and the uproar will get worse. Focus on the quiet moments when everyone and everything is functioning harmoniously and that peace will soon expand.<br><br>In the same vein, focus on all the reasons you can't achieve something or why it can't be done -- and presto -- you'll prove yourself right, or find more reasons than you thought imaginable. Focus on what you don't like about something or somebody and sure enough, you'll find more and more of those traits.<br><br>"I get it now," a woman at a recent session called out as we discussed the energy circle.<br><br><i>I'm a mature, rational adult and a very careful driver. I've never had an accident, but suddenly I go through phases of dinging and denting the car. I realize now it's always after my dad visits from out of town. Whenever he visits he always insists that I scoot over to let him drive because, according to him, I'm not a good enough driver. When he leaves, I start running into things. I know now I go toward what I focus on. After a couple of weeks with him, I'm convinced I'm a lousy driver.</i><br><br>A husband and wife said at another seminar, "We're changing from having a 'TV' room to a 'family' room since we know we'll get what we focus on."<br><br>Families can easily find themselves hopelessly mired in the "backward" part of the circle when they gather at the dinner table each night.<br><br>My colleague Allison, for example, grew up in a very verbal family, all lawyers and teachers and writers. But there was also a predominantly negative focus of "Can you top this?" to their dinner conversations. Her brother's lousy day in school could be topped by mom's crummy day at home only to be bested by dad's horrible day in court.<br><br><i>We learned to score points by having the worst anecdotes. Unfortunately this translated into some pretty dismal responses when people would ask me, as an adult, how things were going.<br><br>Unlike those reticent Minnesotans Garrison Keillor describes so well, I wouldn't even say, "OK, could be better." or "So-so, can't complain." Instead, I had learned how to make sure the inquirer knew my life was going much worse than his was. He'd get the full story on why I was too tired, too overworked, too underpaid...whatever was my lousiest item of the day. It's pretty scary to think what kind of life most people must have imagined I led.<br><br>And, of course, I believed all that too. We go toward what we focus on! What a disgusting bunch of barriers I had erected to really enjoying my life!</i><br><br>Imagine how your children will grow up if you ask questions like these at the dinner table or when you talk to them on the phone:<br><br>* What was the best thing that happened to you today?<br><br>* What did you do better today than you've ever done before?<br><br>* What did you do today that let you know how special you are?<br><br>* Of all the things we do together as a family, what do you like best?<br><br>(Other examples of forward focus questions appear at the end of this chapter.)<br><br>You notice these questions require something more than a simple "yes'" or "no" answer, and keep people's energy moving forward rather than backward where they're stuck on what's not working.<br><br>Does this mean we ignore the crappy stuff that happens to our family or that we try to maintain an artificially "positive" attitude? Absolutely not! There are many times when we do have upsetting feelings like sadness, or anger, or fear, or disappointment. These are normal, not bad. The only "bad" feelings are those that are stuffed away or ignored. Forward focus is about managing energy, but there's no energy to manage, nor any way to manage it, if our feelings are in the way.<br><br>Denying feelings is what creates dysfunctional families. How can any child grow up whole whose feelings are constantly discounted? How does a child develop a sense of self if he or she must conform only to what is "acceptable" to the person or situation his or her family tiptoes around?<br><br>Children simply tune out and ultimately turn off when they are not allowed to own their own feelings. A close friend of mine did just that, resulting in lots of pain and expensive therapy as an adult.<br><br><i>In my house it was my dad's way or no way. I'd hear, "How can you be hungry?" when I knew my tummy was rumbling. Or, "Eat now or not at all," when I wasn't the least bit hungry.<br><br>And that was just the simple stuff. Everything I liked or didn't like, wanted or didn't want, enjoyed or hated was questioned. "How could you possibly like that?" I'd hear. I didn't know how, but I knew I liked it. At least I did for a while. Soon I simply stopped feeling because not one emotion I had was acknowledged or validated.</i><br><br>We certainly will not agree with everything our children feel, but it is crucially important that we honor whatever feelings they have. That gift alone could be one of our biggest contributions to their lives.<br><br>I'm keenly aware that there are times when our circumstances seem too overwhelming to deal with on our own. Divorce, financial problems, job loss, poor health -- so many situations in our lives can drag us over into the back side of the energy circle and keep us stuck there. In such situations, you cannot always expect to overcome these obstacles alone. Seek help and counseling from your church or a therapist if you feel overwhelmed.<br><br>But even in the midst of intense personal pain, managing your focus can be an extremely beneficial tool for you and your family. Allison continues her story.<br><br><i>I enjoyed 16 years of a growing, successful career as editor of a local newspaper. Then the company was sold, and suddenly, like so many thousands of other people in recent years, my job was eliminated, literally overnight. I was asked to clear out my desk and be gone in two days.<br><br>Sixteen years of professional life erased in a mere 48 hours! There was no farewell party, not even an opportunity to say goodbye to all those wonderful people who had played such a big part in my life. There was no closure, no finale, just watching my professional life dribbling out in ugly little tasks of sorting and packing, trying to leave some continuity behind for my colleagues.<br><br>After my intense anger subsided, an equally intense depression consumed me. I was paralyzed with fear: I was single, middle-aged, had a son in college, and no prospects in a nearly impenetrable job market. People who were accustomed to hearing me describe what a backward-focused life I led before certainly didn't want to talk to me now.<br><br>I thought there would be no end to the helplessness and hopelessness that engulfed my life. I had adverse physical reactions to every antidepressant the doctor prescribed, so I couldn't even rely on medication for relief. I was convinced I was in a tunnel where the only light would not be at the other end but from an oncoming locomotive.<br><br>Life slogged on for months, pretty much flat line by now. No real ups or downs, no joy, no pain. But I started to notice a difference when I began working with the "10 Greatest Gifts" material. No matter how determined I was to stay stuck in my misery, I'd find myself focused forward after a phone call or meeting with Steve Vannoy. I was fired up to get the next project started or do the next piece of research. I was getting things done! I was actually looking forward to something!<br><br>While I was far from complete in resolving my depression, I had certainly found a new road to take toward overcoming it. I got it! I could only focus on one thing at a time and if that thing was how lousy I felt, or how depressed I was, or how many bills were piling up, that's what I got -- lousier, more depressed and larger and larg...</i></p><h2>Roger Maris: Baseball&#39;s Reluctant Hero</h2><p><b><i>The definitive biography of the baseball legend who broke Babe Ruth&#x2019;s single-season home-run record&#x2014;the natural way&#x2014;and withstood a firestorm of media criticism to become one of his era&#x2019;s preeminent players. <br><br></i></b>ROGER MARIS may be the greatest ballplayer no one really knows. In 1961, the soft-spoken man from the frozen plains of North Dakota enjoyed one of the most amazing seasons in baseball history, when he outslugged his teammate Mickey Mantle to become the game&#x2019;s natural home-run king. It was Mantle himself who said, "Roger was as good a man and as good a ballplayer as there ever was." Yet Maris was vilified by fans and the press and has never received his due from biographers&#x2014;until now. <br><br>Tom Clavin and Danny Peary trace the dramatic arc of Maris&#x2019;s life, from his boyhood in Fargo through his early pro career in the Cleveland Indians farm program, to his World Series championship years in New York and beyond. At the center is the exciting story of the 1961 season and the ordeal Maris endured as an outsider in Yankee pinstripes, unloved by fans who compared him unfavorably to their heroes Ruth and Mantle, relentlessly attacked by an aggressive press corps who found him cold and inaccessible, and treated miserably by the organization. After the tremendous challenge of breaking Ruth&#x2019;s record was behind him, Maris ultimately regained his love of baseball as a member of the world champion St. Louis Cardinals. And over time, he gained redemption in the eyes of the Yankee faithful. <br><br>With research drawn from more than 130 interviews with Maris&#x2019;s teammates, opponents, family, and friends, as well as 16 pages of photos, some of which have never before been seen, this timely and poignant biography sheds light on an iconic figure from baseball&#x2019;s golden era&#x2014;and establishes the importance of his role in the game&#x2019;s history.</p><p>Tom Clavin is the author or coauthor of sixteen books.

The left-handed pull hitter is exhibiting his much praised swing with extended bat and arms parallel to the ground, his left hand turning over, his right leg straight and left leg flexed, his right foot pointing toward third base and his left one perpendicular to the ground, his muscles in his face, neck, and upper arms tense, and his hips rotating.<br> <br>The second picture, taken from the front, was of Maris one breath later. With, surprisingly, still-seated fans behind him, he is completing his pivot, releasing the bat with his left hand, and watching with hopeful eyes the flight of his historic home run into Yankee Stadium&#x2019;s packed right-field stands.<br> <br>But even the award winners among them missed something quite extraordinary that took place seconds later. Fortunately, one of the greatest, if most neglected, visual metaphors in sports history would be preserved on celluloid.<br> <br>Having completed what his bedridden Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle always called the &#x201c;greatest sports feat I ever saw,&#x201d; the new single-season home-run champion dropped his bat and ran down the baseline. He rounded first at the same time nineteen-year-old Sal Durante held up the 61st home-run ball in his right hand; another ecstatic young male fan leaped onto the field; and the clearly dejected Red Sox pitcher concocted an upbeat postgame response to the media (&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll now make some money on the banquet circuit!&#x201d;).<br> <br>As he neared second base, Maris suddenly escaped dark shadows and moved into the bright, warm sunlight. Just like that, he had finally found a slice of heaven after a long season he&#x2019;d sum up as &#x201c;sheer hell.&#x201d;<br> <br>In Roger Maris&#x2019;s version of hell, he was the prey in a daily media feeding frenzy, lost his privacy, shed some hair, received hate mail by the bundle, experienced vicious heckling from even home fans, and, having arrived in New York from Kansas City only twenty-two months before, was treated by the Yankees organization like an outsider, an ugly duckling in a pond of swans. His blow on the last day of the season was a telling response to all that nonsense.<br> <br>Maris ran as he always did after a home run&#x2014;head down and at a measured pace, exhibiting nothing offensively ostentatious or celebratory, nothing to indicate he was circling the bases one time more in a season than anyone else in history. He was pounded on the back by joyous third-base coach Frank Crosetti as he came down the homestretch. Crossing home plate, he was greeted by on-deck batter Yogi Berra, then batboy Frank Prudenti, and, finally, the anonymous Zelig-like fan. Then he made his way into the dugout&#x2014;at least he tried to. Several Yankees formed a barricade and turned Maris around and pushed him upward so he could acknowledge the standing ovation.<br> <br>He reluctantly inched back up the steps, stretching his neck as if he were a turtle warily emerging from its shell. He dutifully waved his cap and gave his teammates a pleading look, hoping they would agree that he had been out there too long already. They urged him to stay put and allow the fans to shower him with the adulation that had been missing all year. So he waved his hat some more and smiled sheepishly.<br> <br>The television camera zoomed in, and everyone could see that during his sunlit jaunt around the bases, he had, amazingly, been tranformed. With the burden of unreasonable expectations suddenly lifted and the knowledge that not one more dopey reporter would ask, &#x201c;Are you going to break Babe Ruth&#x2019;s record, Rog?&#x201d; the strain in his face and haunted look in his eyes had vanished. He no longer looked double his twenty-seven years and on the verge of a meltdown.<br> <br>Baseball fans would, in their mind&#x2019;s eye, freeze-frame forever this image of the young, cheery innocent with the trademark blond crewcut who had just claimed sports&#x2019; most revered record. For that one moment Maris believed all the bad stuff was behind him. For that one brief moment, he felt free. In reality, it was the calm before an even more vicious storm. He couldn&#x2019;t know that the press would not back off and the fickle, media-manipulated fans who had rooted against his breaking the record in 1961 would boo him in 1962 for not breaking it again.<br> <br>Having come from a small town where privacy was cherished and celebrity was nonexistent, Maris was mystified that the media and the fans actually wanted to know anything about him. As Jim Murray of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> observed, &#x201c;Roger Maris was about as well equipped for fame as a forest ranger.&#x201d; It was true to form that he revealed far less about himself in <i>Roger Maris At Bat,</i> the autobiographical book he wrote with veteran reporter Jim Ogle after the &#x2019;61 season, than in <i>Slugger in Right,</i> an obscure, semiautobiographical novel they wrote the following year about a troubled young Yankee right fielder named Billy Mack.<br> <br>By all accounts, through 1961 Maris was considerate of reporters who needed copy and was regarded by teammates and opponents alike as one of the most quiet, shy, and decent people they had ever met. So it was all the more unjust that <i>he</i> would have the dubious distinction of being the first ballplayer that a large segment of the press went after, almost as savagely as the white press had attacked African-American heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson half a century before. Unprotected by the Yankees, he was the guinea pig for a new breed of hip, no-holds-barred reporters who wanted to flex their muscles and show they had the power to destroy a star player&#x2019;s reputation and his psyche.<br> <br>That he accepted the brutally negative and often untruthful things written about him in 1961 and later years, rather than trying to make peace with the press in exchange for favorable coverage, eventually stripped him of his enthusiasm for baseball and cost him a legitimate shot at being selected to the Hall of Fame. He was too stubborn, too self-destructive, and too true to himself&#x2014;and a bit too self-righteous&#x2014;to compromise when he believed he was wronged. &#x201c;When I think I am right,&#x201d; he declared in <i>Roger Maris At Bat,</i> &#x201c;there is no man who is going to tell me that I am wrong unless he can PROVE IT to me. As long as I know I am right I&#x2019;m going to put up an argument regardless of the consequences.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The fact is,&#x201d; said his wife, Pat Maris, &#x201c;that his combination of shyness and outspokenness confuses people who do not know him very well.&#x201d;<br> <br>How did Roger Maris get that way? Surely he was the product of both family and the part of the country where he was raised. Yet even there he stood apart.<br> <br>ï¿½ 2010 Tom Clavin and Danny Peary</p><h2>Oedipus and Akhnaton: Myth and History</h2><p>Velikovsky connects the events recounted in the Oedipus cycle with those of the Egyptian King Akhnaton, considered the first monotheist, father of King Tutankhamen.

Now, having retired from lecturing, Jan writes historical fiction full-time, embroidering as a side-line, reading, painting, and listening to good music."If you have ever hesitated before attempting to draw to stitch a portrait, or been frustrated by drawing faces or hands &#x2013; even if you have never picked up a pencil before &#x2013; then this book is the ideal place to start." &#x2014;<i>Embroidery </i>magazine (November 2012)<br><br>"The extensive photography is extremely clear and sometimes brutally close-up, but essential for the reader to understand the execution of the techniques and their effects on the fabric. As ever with Jan Messent's books, this is a remarkable publication and one that many embroiderers will find an inspirational addition to their bookshelves." &#x2014;<i>New Stitches</i> (November 2012)</p><h2>Dolores Claiborne</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. Accused of murdering the old woman whose house she cleaned, Dolores Claiborne is forced to explain a few things from her past, like the circumstances surrounding her husband&#39;s death years before.</p><p>More of a mystery than a horror novel, <i>Dolores Claiborne</i> contains only the briefest glances at the supernatural. The novel presents Stephen King as a writer experimenting with style and narrative, time and perspective. Fans looking for a skin-crawling, page-turning fright or an undead bloodbath will be disappointed, but a patient reader willing to savor King's leisurely study of character and island life will find many rewards. And all of this is not to say that the book is without suspense.<p> The story unfolds in one continuous chapter, told in the first person by the cranky, 65-year-old housekeeper, Dolores, who is explaining to police officers and a stenographer how and why she killed her husband, Joe, 30 years ago. At the same time, in her rambling monologue, she insists that she did <i>not</i> kill her longtime employer, Vera Donovan--notwithstanding what the residents of Little Tall Island may be whispering. Joe was a drinker, and, as Dolores gradually argues, he deserved to die for the horrifying crimes he committed against his family. But Vera, despite her cantankerous disposition as a lady governing her decaying estate with her precise rules about even the most mundane household chore ("Six pins! Remember to use six pins! Don't you let the wind blow my good sheets down to the corner of the yard!"), was a good woman--or at least not an evil one. She was the woman who hired the young Dolores and kept her on even after Dolores got pregnant again. Dolores cleaned and cared for her even as the old matron faded into senility.</p><p> <i>Dolores Claiborne</i> is a rich novel that recalls the regionalist writing of the turn of the century. It is a fine place for a skeptical newcomer--put off by King's reputation for outright terror--to start. And for fans, it is a book that offers new insights into an author who's an old favorite. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Stephen King</b> lives in Maine and Florida with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.

Virginia Lee Williams is an award-winning collage artist who teaches watercolor workshops in watermedia collage.Collage is a versatile and dynamic medium suitable for artists with any level of skill and experience. Collage can be spontaneous and inexpensive when artists use materials at hand, such as magazines or newspapers, or collage can involve elaborate designs, precise detail, and exquisite craftsmanship. Materials suitable for collage are limited only by the creator's imagination and include papers of all kinds, fabric, photographs, and three-dimensional objects. Media such as watercolor, ink, and acrylics can be used to create varied effects and textures. Instructor, artist, and author Leland and her collage-artist coauthor Williams provide readers with step-by-step instructions for increasingly sophisticated collage techniques. Charts highlight recommended materials such as adhesives, protective coatings, types of paper, and supports. Numerous examples of finished collages are displayed in color reproductions, from homey family projects to beautifully textured abstractions. While Leland and Williams excel at covering technique and practical concerns, they spend some time discussing design principles and the matching of materials to subject or theme. This is as comprehensive and useful as a how-to on collage can be. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Whosoever Will: A Biblical-Theological Critique of Five-Point Calvinism</h2><p><p>Arising from the John 3:16 Conference held in late 2008 at First Baptist Church of Woodstock, Georgia, <i>Whosoever Will </i>presents a biblical-theological assessment of and response to five-point Calvinism.

She is a teacher, writer, and craftsman and has worked with gold, silver, and precious stones. She is the author of a previous book, The Universal Bead. She is married to the noted psychoanalyst Erik H. Erikson.This addition to the literature on aging focuses on the need for the elderly to remain vitally involved in the present. In the first chapter Erikson outlines his now famous theory of the eight-stage life cycle. Chapter two consists of often repetitious reflections on the results of interviews with 29 octogenarians from the Berkeley, California area. The third chapter is a reworking of a previously published essay exploring the life history of the protagonist depicted in Bergman's film classic Wild Strawberries. The concluding chapter discusses some of the issues associated with old age in the United States. The book will interest those who wish to learn how Erikson's psychosocial themes relate to the last stage of life. Robin B.

In what has to be viewed as one of the most shameful periods in American political history, Filipinos who believed they had been promised independence were instead told they were incapable of self-government and then violently subdued in a war that featured torture and execution of native soldiers and civilians. The United States also used its growing military and political might to grab the entirety of the Hawaiian Islands and a large section of Panama.<br><br> As secretary of state during this time, Hay, though a charitable man, was nonetheless complicit in these misdeeds. Clemens, a staunch critic of his country&#x2019;s imperialistic actions, was forced by his own financial and family needs to temper his remarks. Nearing the end of their long and remarkable lives, both men found themselves struggling to maintain their personal integrity while remaining celebrated and esteemed public figures.<br><br> Written with a keen eye--Mark Zwonitzer is also an award-winning documentary filmmaker--and informed by the author&#x2019;s deep understanding of the patterns of history, <i>The Statesman and the Storyteller</i> has the compelling pace of a novel, the epic sweep of historical writing at its best, and, in capturing the essence of the lives of Hay and Twain, the humanity and nuance of masterful biography.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>&#x201c;What a riveting book.

John Hay is enjoying a new round of political influence now as the Republican Party revives his memory to try to inspire a post&#x2013;Bush-Cheney conservative foreign policy renaissance. But here is Hay in life and in the politics of his time, seen as clearly as we have ever seen him: challenged and brilliant and human.

How people regard <i>older </i>animals is especially revealing. <i>Beautiful Old Dogs </i>is a heartfelt, emotional, passionate tribute to old dogs. It will inspire many readers to get involved in senior dog rescue and adoption, as it honors our senior best friends and explores their current state of care and custody in an informative appendix. This book features the exquisite photography of the late Garry Gross, a noted fashion photographer during the 60s, 70s and 80s who, after becoming a highly successful dog trainer in New York City, turned his camera lens towards dogs. Gross, along with Victoria Stilwell from Animal Planet's <i>It's Me or the Dog, </i>founded Dog Trainers of New York in 2002, and became devoted to highlighting the plight and value of senior dogs. "The older the better," Gross said. "Dogs with soul in their eyes."<br>David Tabatsky has collected Gross's photographs here, and carefully curated an accompanying selection of moving, insightful, funny, and uplifting essays and short pieces by a range of writers, with contributions from Anna Quindlen, Ally Sheedy, Christopher Durang, Doris Day, Dean Koontz, Marlo Thomas, and many more.</p></p><p>DAVID TABATSKY is a writer, editor, teacher and performing artist.

They won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for stories about the lack of the rule of law in Mexico and the horrific conditions in the Mexican criminal justice system. Formerly the Post's correspondents in Tokyo, they also won a George Polk Award in 1998 for their reporting about the Asian financial crisis, as well as awards from the Society of Professional Journalists and the Overseas Press Club of America.In early 2002, we asked a young woman on Islas Marï¿½as, a prison in the Pacific Ocean about 100 miles off the Mexican coast, how she liked being an inmate there. She bubbled on about the beautiful ocean setting and the fresh air, and she said it was sure better than the last prison she'd been in. She had come from La Mesa prison in Tijuana, the border city across from San Diego, where she said the conditions were brutal.<p></p><p>"The only good thing about that place was that Irish nun," she said.</p><p>Come again?</p><p>She told us about a nun, an Irishwoman she said, who lived in a cell alongside the inmates, helping to feed and clothe them and protect them from abuse by guards.</p><p>"I miss talking to her," she said.</p><p>We wrote ourselves a note: Find nun who lives in prison.</p><p>A few weeks later, we stood outside the imposing front gate of La Mesa, a fortress of twenty-five-foot walls in the middle of a downtown Tijuana neighborhood.</p><p>Mother Antonia came to greet us at the gate, a cheery little woman in a black-and-white habit.</p><p>We sat with her, and she told us about her life, about how she was raised as a well-off girl in Beverly Hills with neighbors like Spencer Tracy. (She turned out to be Irish American.) She talked about how she spent three decades as a suburban mom in Los Angeles, raising seven children.</p><p>She told us about poor people locked up for years for stealing food, about the famous drug dealers whose bullet-blasted bodies she had washed and dressed for burial. We listened, and we were hooked. Together, we have been interviewing people as journalists for more than forty years. We have interviewed presidents and rock stars, survivors of typhoons in India, and people tortured by the Taliban in Afghanistan. We had never heard a story quite like hers, a story of such powerful goodness. This was a tale that needed telling.</p><p>For starters, we wrote a story about her life that appeared on the front page of <i>The Washington Post</i> on April 10, 2002. In the weeks that followed, letters and e-mails came pouring in. People wanted to know how to help her. A gay Catholic man wrote to say his faith had been renewed by the story of how a divorced woman had not let the church's rules diminish her faith. An old boyfriend, who had not seen her since World War II scuttled their plans for a life together, saw the story and wrote to her-in care of the prison-and they talked for the first time in fifty-seven years. Kathleen Todora, a widow from Louisiana, read the story, packed her bags, and drove to Tijuana to join Mother Antonia's mission.</p><p>That response confirmed what we already knew: Mother Antonia was rare, and those whose lives are touched by hers are affected forever. She gets under your skin, and she changes you, whether it's seeing a little more humanity in a street beggar, or no longer being able to look at a Starbucks caffe latte without imagining how much better that four dollars could have been used.</p><p>This book is a work of journalism, not an "as told to" story. Mother Antonia is the first to say she isn't perfect. She has struggled with real life problems; she has known the highs of marrying for love and lows of divorce when that love dies. Suffering from poor health for a lifetime, she has ignored her ailments, grabbed hold of her gifts, and used them to do extraordinary things. She is the happiest person we have ever met.</p><p>For almost three years, we have conducted hundreds of hours of interviews with Mother Antonia. We gave her a tape recorder and tapes and asked her to tell us the stories of her life. We have sat with her in the prison and in her small house nearby filled with an eclectic mix of women: inmates just leaving the prison; women receiving cancer treatments; and mothers, daughters, and girlfriends who have come long distances to visit men in prison and have no money to stay anywhere else.</p><p>We have also talked about Mother Antonia with her friends, family, bishops, inmates, guards, wardens, police chiefs, DEA agents, Army generals, and even Benjamï¿½n Arellano Fï¿½lix, one of Mexico's most notorious drug traffickers. In all possible instances, we have checked and double-checked their stories with witnesses, public records, old newspaper clippings from the Library of Congress, and even in an eye-opening interview with an ultrasecret DEA informant we were introduced to only as Comandante X. We have been amazed at the accuracy of Mother Antonia's memories, even those from a half-century ago. She remembered Eddie Cantor's street address from the 1930s. And she remembered it right.</p><p>People of all faiths, or of no faith, are drawn to Mother Antonia's message of inclusion. She loves the Catholic Church, but not all its rules. She wears over her heart a cross interlaced with the Star of David, a symbol of her devotion to the Jewish faith and the lesson she learned from the Holocaust as a young girl, that no one should stand by silently in the face of suffering. Some of her most generous financial supporters are Evangelical Christians in California. Mother Antonia thinks God doesn't check IDs at Heaven's gate.</p><p>In the end, this is the story of a woman who followed a dream later in life. She was fifty when she traded suburban Los Angeles for La Mesa. Mother Antonia's hope is that she will be joined by more and more women, and someday also men, who are looking for ways to give meaning to their later years. She believes that the world is full of older people with long experience who now want to help others. We think she's right. Especially since the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and all that has followed, we think more people are looking for a way to do something to make the world a little warmer.</p><p>A couple of mechanical points.</p><p>Mother Antonia is occasionally referred to in the book as Sister Antonia. It's a linguistic difference. In English, we are used to calling members of Catholic religious orders Sister. In Spanish, the more common expression is Madre-mother. To all her Mexican friends, she is La Madre Antonia. We have preserved that here, while letting English-speakers call her Sister Antonia.</p><p>When we use the authorial "we," it means that one of us, or both, saw or heard whatever is being described. It would be too distracting to write, "she said to Kevin," or, "Mary saw." We could never get away with such imprecise attribution in The Washington Post. But in our marriage, "we" has come to mean either or both of us. And for the sake of kindness to our readers, "we" means that here, too.</p><p>ONE</p><p>LA MADRE</p><p>A riot rages inside La Mesa state penitentiary in Tijuana, Mexico. It's Halloween night, 1994, and the twenty-five hundred convicts locked inside one of the country's most violent and overcrowded prisons are struggling, as they do every day, to live one more.</p><p>Sixteen men are locked in a block of punishment cells on the third floor. They are there for insulting guards, fighting with other prisoners, breaking the rules. They've been here for days, some for weeks. They are agitated and angry. There is never enough food in these cells, there are never enough blankets for the cold nights. It's filthy. Worst of all, visitors aren't allowed up here. No place in the prison is harsher than these fetid punishment cells, and it's never been worse than tonight. The men can hear parties for Day of the Dead ringing from homes just outside the walls. It's one of Mexico's biggest days of the year, a big, happy, noisy family celebration honoring the departed. Families are together at home or in decorated graveyards filled with light and music and tequila and the hottest, sweetest bread you can imagine, and here they are, stuck in the hole.</p><p>It's too much, just too damned much. The prisoners come up with a plan. Someone calls a guard over to ask him a question. When he comes close enough, arms quickly pass through the bars and grab him, pinning him there and taking his gun and his keys. The prisoners quickly free themselves, then grab another guard and his gun, too. They tell the guards to get the hell out, then they set mattresses on fire in the cellblock and start shooting into the air out the windows.</p><p>Fearing the worst, the guards abandon their posts and shut off the electricity. Much of the prison now belongs to the inmates, and it's completely dark except for the flames rising from the top-floor windows. Outside in the crowded neighborhood of modest concrete homes that has grown up around La Mesa, people see the fire and hear the gunshots for blocks.</p><p>Police in riot gear show up. SWAT teams assemble on the streets. Television cameras set up quickly. Mothers and girlfriends of prisoners have come running, and they are watching a small army preparing to storm the prison.</p><p>"My son, my son, what are they going to do to him?" one woman wails.</p><p>Then into the darkness comes a tiny woman in a white habit.</p><p>She has clear white skin and round cheeks, and her smile seems to start in her bright blue eyes then spread across her face until it glows. She looks so happy.</p><p>"ï¿½Madre! ï¿½Madre!" the desperate women call out, holding out their arms and running to her.</p><p>Everyone knows her. She is Mother Antonia. She's the American sister who lives in a cell and shivers in the same cold showers as the prisoners. She calls the men mis hijos, my sons, and brings a mother's love to some of Mexico's most forgotten. There are rumors that she was rich once, maybe even a millionaire or a movie star. Nobody really knows exactly where she came from or why, but they know she will help them, and they know the prisoners trust her more than anybody else.</p><p>Mother Antonia was on an errand outside the prison when she heard about the trouble and has come rushing back to her adopted home, with its imposing walls and guard towers. She hears the ominous snaps and clacks of ammunition being loaded and smells the acrid fire. Terrified women mob her.</p><p>"Calm down," she says. "This is not the time to be screaming. The men can hear you in there. They're going to be all right, but you need to pray, not yell. Everything will be all right. I'm going to go inside to see your sons-my sons-right now."</p><p>The television cameras record it all and follow her as she turns and walks toward the darkened prison entrance. The warden, Jorge Alberto Duarte Castillo, is out of town. His assistant stops her at the office by the gate.</p><p>"I can't let you go in there, Mother. It's too dangerous right now."</p><p>She insists. She demands that he call her friend Duarte. She is sure he will give permission for her to go inside. It is her home and her life. She is needed in there now. He calls, and she tells Duarte she wants to talk to her hijos and persuade them to end the violence.</p><p>"No, Mother, you can't go in. It's too dangerous," he says on the other end of the phone.</p><p>"Jorge, you know my mission is to be in there right now," she says. "This isn't a time to back out."</p><p>Jorge Duarte knows the prisoners listen to her. He also knows that she is right, that a massacre could well be in the making; it has happened too many times before. He gives the order to let her in.</p><p>A guard unlocks the door and lets her pass</p><p>It is black dark inside. She is alone, walking slowly down empty hallways, feeling her way along a route she knows so well. She can hear the shots and smell the smoke from upstairs. When the lights went out, some prisoners had run to their cells while others hid under tables and behind doors. Now they come out, surprised to see Mother Antonia instead of riot police.</p><p>"Mother, what are you doing in here?" one asks her.</p><p>First one, then five, then more prisoners gather around her in the darkness. They tell her that she should get out, she could be killed. Don't worry, she tells them, I'll be safe. She leads the men, mostly poor young Catholic Mexicans raised to worship God and their mothers, into the small chapel off the prison yard. She kneels and prays out loud for angels to protect everyone in the prison. Then she rises and heads out the door, an inch at a time in the darkness, toward the punishment cells.</p><p>She shuffles her feet carefully along the prison's cement floor, her outstretched hands feeling the way along the walls. Finding the stairway leading up, she realizes she is not alone in the blackness. The men have stayed with her. She doesn't know if there are five or fifty, but she feels them and hears them all around her like a human shield. She is the closest thing to heaven most of them have ever seen, this woman who brings them pillows and pure white bandages, who keeps the guards from beating them, who never stops hugging them and telling them they are loved. They call her Mother. And they are going to take a bullet rather than have <i>La Madre</i> die tonight.</p><p>She can feel the heavy black metal doors of cells as she passes them. The screams and shooting are close now, the smoke is sharp in her eyes and lungs. She calls out to the men in the punishment cells.</p><p>They are shocked to hear her.</p><p>"Don't shoot! Mother's here!" they yell.</p><p>"Mother Antonia! Get out of here. You'll be killed!" one inmate shouts. "Please, go. You'll be shot!"</p><p>She doesn't stop. She moves forward toward their voices.</p><p>"What's going on here? The whole city is terrified," she says. "Your mothers and girlfriends and children are outside crying. Please stop. There's an army out there getting ready to come in."</p><p>She tells them that if they don't put down their weapons, more children will be orphaned, including their own. Think of your parents crying at another family funeral, she pleads. Her voice is warm, convincing, and urgent, and it suddenly changes the ugly night.</p><p>The metal door to the punishment cell block opens. She can now see a bit by the light of burning mattresses. Her white clothes are singed with ash. An inmate she knows as Blackie steps forward from the shadows.</p><p>"Mother..."</p><p>She pushes her way inside like a running back.</p><p>"C'mon, C'mon. Give me the guns. Give me the guns right now. I'm not going to let you get hurt. I'm not going to let them hurt you and punish you. Give me the guns."</p><p>"Mother," Blackie says. "We've been up here so long they've forgotten us. The water's gone, and we're desperate."</p><p>Mother Antonia falls to her knees in the smoky hallway. She is right in front of Blackie, looking up at him with her hands held out, palms up, pleading with him.</p><p>"It's not right that you're locked up here, hungry and thirsty. We can take care of those things, but this isn't the way to do it. I will help you make it better. But first, you have to give me the guns. I beg you to put down your weapons."</p><p>"Mother," Blackie says softly, looking down at her. "As soon as we heard your voice, we dropped the guns out the window."</p><p>Mother Antonia walks Blackie downstairs to the gate, shouting to the guards and police that he is coming out, unarmed. Duarte has hurried back from Mexicali, a nearby city, and arrives at the prison just in time to see Mother Antonia and Blackie emerge from the darkened yard. They all sit in Duarte's office, and he listens to Blackie's long list of complaints. The two men agree to a settlement. Blackie promises an end to the violence. Duarte promises better conditions. The lights come back up in the prison. ...</p></p><h2>The Holy Spirit: Ancient Christian Traditions</h2><p>In <i>The Holy Spirit: Ancient Christian Traditions</i> (formerly titled <i>The Spirit and the Church: Antiquity),</i> the first in a series of three volumes devoted to the history of Christian pneumatology, Stanley M. Burgess Recounts Christian efforts from the end of the first century to the end of the fifth century AD to understand the divine Third Person.<p>The Christian centuries have witnessed a tensionï¿½&#x2014;sometimes waxing, sometimes waning, but always presentï¿½&#x2014;between the spirit of order and the spirit of prophecy. In the ancient church, representatives of institutional order, in an effort to keep the development of Spirit doctrine within a recognizable tradition, muffled the immediacy of religious experience. Prophetic elements came to be viewed with distrust and remained in the institutional church only at the cost of severe internal tension. In this work, the author recognizes the wealth of Spirit theology and activity in both traditions, and the need for modern Christians to gain a deeper and wider vision of the workings of the Holy Spirit in history and in our own generation.</p></p><p>Dr. Stanley M.

Driven by the conviction that the work of the Impressionists was an artistic revelation, he led the fight against critical opinion and brought these artists to the public. His event-filled life is the subject of this absorbing biography. <br><br>Durand-Ruel risked his name, his fortune, and his family's future to become the outspoken champion of Impressionism, an art form that in France provoked only insults. By 1900 his gallery dominated the international market for Impressionism, and he had inspired a new generation of collectors, from merchant princes of Moscow to steel barons of Pittsburgh. This volume, deftly crafted from unpublished documents and letters, and illustrated with 40 black-and-white images, is an important addition to our understanding of Impressionism and collecting, as well as a dazzling tour of French and American art and cultural politics in the years before World War I.

Kahnweiler</i>.</p><p>Pierre Assouline is one of France's leading historians and biographers. His many books include <i>An Artful Life: A Biography of D. H. Kahnweiler</i>.This account of the life of Paul Durand-Ruel, a renowned dealer in Impressionist paintings, is not so much a biography as a breezy, rambling account of the French art world in the second half of the 19th century, with Durand-Ruel as a focal point that never quite comes into focus&#x2014;despite the fact that Assouline claims an almost queasy level of intimacy with his subject. He seems to be stretching the bounds of available evidence when he speculates, for example, that "Paul felt himself secretly ... stronger" than other art dealers because he grew up among artists and, thus, "absorbed painting with his mother&#x2019;s milk." Much of his narrative is related with the perfunctory storytelling and cheap emotions of a made-for-TV movie. When Durand-Ruel&#x2019;s sister dies, Assouline declares that the dealer "lost the person who had been his guide and support for as long as he could remember"&#x2014;never mind that this sister has been scarcely spoken of before and is never mentioned again. Even when the book enters the engrossing territory of the rise of Impressionism as a movement&#x2014;which Assouline chronicles with lengthy quotations from scandalized art critics of the period&#x2014;the narrative stalls out with bathetic generalizations: e.g., "We can only make deductions from the clues that exist, since we are not party to secrets, swept into wretched little piles or raised to the height of pyramids, that sometimes remain inviolate for a whole lifetime." To his credit, Assouline devotes a fair amount of space to one of the most absorbing mysteries of Durand-Ruel&#x2019;s life&#x2014;namely, how the art dealer could be at once an anti-Semitic monarchist and a proponent of progressive art&#x2014;but his discussion characteristically loses focus and meanders away without coming to any conclusions. This is a sentimental and poorly organized tour of what should be fascinating cultural terrain.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, a confusing array of anecdotal and conflicting indicators often renders it impossible for managers and investors to see where the economy is heading in time to take corrective action. Now, a 35-year Wall Street veteran unveils a new forecasting method to help managers and investors understand and predict the economic cycles that control their businesses and financial fates. In Ahead of the Curve, Joseph H. Ellis argues that the problem with current forecasting models lies not in the data, but rather in the lack of a clear framework for putting the data in context and reading it correctly. The book explains critical economic indicators in nontechnical language, identifies and documents the recurring cause-and-effect relationships that consistently predict turning points in the economy, and provides the tools managers and investors need to position themselves ahead of cyclical upturns and downturns. Economic events are not as random and unpredictable as they seem. This book helps readers recognize and react to signs of change that their rivals don't see&#x2014;and win a sizeable competitive advantage. Joseph H.

The plan is to hijack a $400 million cruise ship and hold its 2,000 passengers for ransom. Butler Jack has an obsession with etymology, and he is more than happy to lecture his hostages on the derivation of the word "hijack," which is descended from "Jack" which comes from the Middle English "Jakke," which meant "ordinary guy." Our Jack is an ordinary guy who just happens to have the mind of a genius and a passion for grisly killing.In his official Fiesta Cruise Lines shirt, Emilio Sanchez stood before the bathroom mirror squinting at his new tummy bulge.&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue rugby shirt was hugging him tight at the belly, showing off the extra couple of inches of flab. <br> <br>What it was, was too much cruise line food for the last six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;First time in his life he'd had a chance to eat three meals a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he was, only twenty-four years old, way too young to get a gut.&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't watch out, soon he'd be looking like all those American passengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse than that, with a big gringo belly he wasn't as likely to score with the ladies. <br> <br>Emilio was sucking in his stomach, staring at his profile when the door to his cabin opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tindu, his Filipino roommate, probably ducking in from the first dinner seating for a quick smoke. <br> <br>Emilio smoothed his hand over his stomach, flattened it briefly, and decided tomorrow he would begin a diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminate breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be easiest. Eat two meals a day instead of three.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop ten pounds by the time of the anniversary cruise.&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;An easy decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex was a hell of a lot more important to Emilio Sanchez than breakfast. <br> <br>He ran a quick comb through his thick black hair and turned from the mirror and the first thing he saw was the glitter of the blade.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a large knife. He'd seen bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times in his life he'd faced knives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking cuts on both arms and one deep wound to his left shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in those Juarez street fights, he had always possessed his own knife. <br> <br>The man in his doorway held the knife in a comfortable underhand grip, left hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing fancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly familiar with its use. <br> <br>"The shirt," the man said. <br> <br>"What? " <br> <br>The man stepped closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want that shirt." <br> <br>"You want my shirt?" Emilio plucked some fabric at his breast.&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shirt?" <br> <br>"I want it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give it to me." <br> <br>He did something with the knife, a little Zorro waggle of his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he held up his right hand and Emilio blinked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn't believe what he was seeing here in his own room.&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy with electricity coming out his fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Knife in one hand, sparks coming out the fingertips of the other. <br> <br>"Hey, man, it's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want the shirt, you got the shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can put the goddamn knife away.&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you the shirt, it's yours, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never liked the fucking shirt in the first place." <br> <br>Emilio stepped back, pulled the shirttail out of his pants, crossed his hands over his stomach ready to drag it off over his head, watching the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want it, what, like for a souvenir or something?" <br> <br>"I need the shirt." Saying it very calm.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like right now." <br> <br>The man wore a black Fiesta Cruise Lines T-shirt and a pair of new blue jeans. The T-shirt said he'd been a Jackpot winner.&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked like a movie star, not the super handsome type, but one of those you've seen all your life, in this and in that, the star's brother or best friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;You've seen him a hundred times, but you never know his name.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those. <br> <br>Blond hair hanging loose down to his shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp;A face that looked like the guy might've been playing with his girlfriend's makeup.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips a little too red, skin a pasty, powdery white.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like you could take a fingernail and scrape some of it off, get down to the real flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;But still handsome, and despite the knife, still somebody it looked like you could reason with. <br> <br>"I got more shirts if you want them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my drawer over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got three or four, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand new practically.&nbsp;&nbsp;You go and take them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Start your own collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't give a shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never liked these fucking shirts." <br> <br>Still gripping his shirttails, arms crossed, ready to strip off the shirt, but trying to talk his way past this, find some way to keep from ducking his head into that blue material, lose sight of the guy in his doorway for even a half second.&nbsp;&nbsp;That knife not moving, just hanging there in front of the guy's belly. The blond man very still, not blinking, nothing. <br> <br>"Go on, take off the shirt." Voice getting quiet now. <br> <br>Emilio shifted his feet, brought his right one back a half step, gonna kick the man in the groin if he came forward at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Punt him up to the Promenade Deck if he tried anything. <br> <br>Emilio tugged on the shirt, made a little feint to see if the guy moved.&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;So Emilio went ahead, stripped out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Losing sight of the guy for a half second was all it was, a half second, couldn't have been any longer than that. <br> <br>The shirt came over his head and Emilio felt a cold jiggle in his belly, and something hot spilling out, running wet down his pants, and he heard the noise coming from his throat, like he was gargling, or puking, like he was out in the alley behind the Kentucky Club back in Juarez, too much cheap tequila, drinking in that bar he remembered now, a place where men stood and guzzled beer and opened their flies right there, a beer in their hand, and pissed into the ceramic trough that ran under the lip of the bar and through a pipe out into the street, a river of urine running down the gutters of Juarez.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of that bar, of that border town, how much he'd wanted to escape that river of piss, go away, see the world, wear nice clothes, meet the blond women, only so he could wind up like this, in a tiny, pathetic fucking room on a ship, a man killing him for his shirt, for his stupid goddamn shirt. <br> <br>And Emilio felt himself falling backward against the sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the man in his doorway, holding the blue cruise lines shirt in one hand and the bloody knife in the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;No smile on his face, nothing at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same look Emilio felt on his own face at that exact moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing there at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never would be again either.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the blond guy, a dead face. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery</h2><p>A probing analysis of the American institution of slavery examines the lives of the slaves, their condition and treatment, the economic repercussions of subjugation, the culture and society surrounding them, and abolitionist movement that helped bring about the end of slavery</p><p>The papers collected in the two volumes of Technical Papers are the outgrowth of an inquiry into the economics and demography of slavery.

His Holy Roman Empire was the embodiment of an ideal that inspired leaders as different as Charles V, Napoleon, and Hitler, each of whom sought to make a unified Europe a reality again in his own time. <br><br>In this new biography, the first major study of Charlemagne in more than twenty-five years, Derek Wilson provides an absorbing and lively account of his life, character, and accomplishments. Charlemagne transcends every notion we have of the traditional historical hero. A military strategist of Julius Caesar&#x2019;s caliber, he had no knowledge of classical history. A ruler with the sagacity of Marcus Aurelius, he ordered summary executions more reminiscent of Caligula or Nero. A devout believer who ensured the survival of Christianity in the West, he considered himself above the Church, sired numerous bastard children, and generated accusations of incest.<br><br>As Wilson describes a Church divided between the Latin West, with its capital in Rome, and the Greek Church of the East, with its capital in Constantinople, we see not only the emergence of Europe but the trials of a Church in flux. The politics of the day were in constant play and were mastered by Charlemagne with cunning and force. By marrying the military might of his army to the spiritual might of the Church in Rome, Charlemagne dominated his world and forged Western Christendom. <br><br>Written by one of England&#x2019;s most respected biographers, <i>Charlemagne</i> is a masterful, multidimensional portrait of a great historical figure&#x2014;a man whose earthly passions were surpassed only by his religious devotion, and whose religious devotion was exceeded only by his will to power.</p><p><p>Derek Wilson graduated from Cambridge in 1961. He spent several years traveling and teaching in Africa before becoming a full-time writer and broadcaster in 1971. His highly acclaimed books include <i>Rothschild: A Story of Wealth and Power</i>, <i>Hans Holbein: Portrait of an Unknown Man</i>, and <i>Tudor Tapestry: Men, Women and Society in Reformation England</i>.

The servants that were with the holy martyr were for defending his life by fighting; but he would not suffer it, declaring that the day he had long waited for was come, which was to bring him to the eternal joys of the Lord. He encouraged the rest to meet with cheerfulness and constancy a death which was to them the gate of everlasting life.(1)<br><br>That account of the death of Boniface, the "Apostle of Germany," in June 754 is important because it marks a turning point in world history. It is also useful as a launchpad for this book because it may help us to get into the right frame of mind to approach the life and times of Charles the Great. Professor Barraclough succinctly observed, "Without Boniface there could have been no Charles"(2) and that is a truth that we in the laid-back, agnostic, twenty-first-century West should not lose sight of. If we find it difficult to understand the mentality of Islamic suicide bombers and tend to be dismissive of all fundamentalisms, then our imaginations need to be jolted so that we can place ourselves alongside the warriors, scholars and missionaries who created and led the first western empire. They were men who believed simply, felt passionately, saw complex issues in black and white, were aggressive in word and deed and understood this world as but a shadow of a greater reality. And it was because they were the men they were--heroes in every sense of the word--that they turned the tide of events, took hold of a culture that seemed doomed to extermination by superior forces and forged the civilization of which we are the heirs.<br><br>The Carolingian prince who would become Charlemagne was only twelve years old when the venerable English missionary, Boniface, went to his death in what is now Holland, but he knew Boniface and the septuagenarian's martyrdom will have made its impact on the boy. Boniface had been a very important figure in the life of Charlemagne's family, a bold, uncompromising religious hero and a Carolingian supporter who inspired gratitude and awe. This bustling, no-nonsense ecclesiastic towered over church life north of the Alps and it was he who legitimized the coup that established Charles' father as the progenitor of a new sovereign dynasty in Francia.<br><br>Frankish dominance in the area west of the Rhine had been established by Clovis in the fifth century, and his descendants of the Merovingian ruling house had pushed their boundaries ever farther. But, in the way of hereditary dynasties, enjoyment of power gradually took the place of effective exercise of power. Successive rulers relied increasingly on their leading court officials, the mayors of the palace, to fight their wars and administer their lands. In 750, the reigning mayor, Pepin III (Pepin the Short), decided to bring this unsatisfactory situation to an end. But, instead of simply seizing power and disposing of Childeric III, the last Merovingian, he sought papal authentication for his usurpation. He sent Rome a message as brief as it was pregnant with significance: "Is it wise to have kings who have no power or control?" Pope Zacharias, who had his own reasons for wishing to oblige Pepin, concluded that it was not wise. Armed with the permission of God's representative on earth, Pepin bundled Childeric off to a monastery where he lived out his days, while Pepin himself was anointed King of the Franks. The man deputed to officiate at this ceremony on Zacharias' behalf was Boniface. It was the forging of this unique bond between the spiritual and terrestrial powers that was to form the basis of what became the Holy Roman Empire. More important, the creation of a religious and civil infrastructure--neither theocracy nor secular state--made possible whatever it is that we call "Europe."<br><br>Only in the closing years of his reign did Charlemagne and his contemporaries begin to think of themselves as Europeans, and any notion they had of a newly emerging cultural entity was, at best, shadowy. They were too close to the political, religious and racial pressures that were forming this entity to be able to give it a name. We must, therefore, take a little time out to study the map of those lands where the slow but dramatic metamorphosis was taking place. The Roman world had been centered on the Mediterranean basin. As the triumphant armies of the Empire and the Republic extended their sway farther and farther from their homeland, they applied vague names to the hinterlands of those regions that remained largely outside their permanent control. To the south, beyond Mare Nostrum, lay Africa. Eastward, over the Hellespont, was Asia. The land on the far side of the Alps bordered only by forbidding forest and the Atlantic world's edge was Europa. The appearance of Christianity as a world religion that replaced tribal and household gods gave the heterogeneous, overextended Roman state what was no more than a semblance of cultural unity and greater political stability, even after Constantine converted to the faith of the crucified Jew.<br><br>Under pressure of the barbarian invasions of the fifth and sixth centuries, the Romano-Christian world contracted to the Mediterranean fringes and to scattered monastic outposts, where men and women of prayer kept the sacred flame of faith and learning flickering and planned the evangelization of their pagan neighbors. Worse was to come in the shape of the Islamic explosion. After the death of Mohammed in 632, his followers, aflame with the zeal of their new faith and a passion for military conquest, surged in all directions from their Arabian heartland. Within a century the Mediterranean, once a Roman lake, was bordered by lands over which the crescent flag flew. From Palestine, along the African littoral, across the Strait of Gibraltar and on to the Pyrenees the champions of the new religion advanced with a speed and success that dwarfed the earlier achievements of Christianity. By the time that Charles, the eldest son of Pepin the Short, was born in 742, the followers of the Cross were everywhere under pressure. The once fiercely thriving North African Church had been obliterated. In the East, the Muslim advance had been halted at the Taurus Mountains, but this had not prevented military expeditions reaching the Bosporus in 673 and 717. In the West, the seemingly inexorable triumph of Islamic arms had only been checked by Pepin's father, Charles Martel, at the Battle of Poitiers in 732. The Christianized transalpine tribes were between the hammer of an aggressive Islam and the anvil of disparate pagan communities to the east and northeast--Frisians, Saxons and Alemanni--who were themselves being harassed by the westward-thrusting Slavs.<br><br>As if that were not bad enough, the professional Church was in a perilous state. Ever since Constantine had moved his capital to the Golden Horn, a gulf had grown between the leaders of the Latin Church in Rome and the Greek patriarchs of Byzantium. Since both priestly houses claimed unifying authority, they effectively divided the Christian world. But that was only one of several tears in the seamless robe of Christ. Throughout the Latin half of the Church there was scant uniformity of either belief or practice. Wherever mass conversions were achieved, they usually involved an element of compromise with prevailing customs. Thus pagan and Christian symbols are often found side by side in ancient burials. Some Germanic tribes had actually embraced the old heresy of Arianism, outlawed at the Council of Nicaea in 325, to demonstrate their independence from the pope. In 664 it took a very acrimonious debate at the Synod of Whitby to induce the Celtic Church to celebrate Easter on the same date as the "mother" Church in Rome. Even where orthodoxy was impeccable, morality often was not. In a turbulent age the authority of the clergy depended almost entirely on their education and the purity of their lives. All too often they forfeited any influence they might have enjoyed by ignorant and unbridled behavior. The peripatetic Boniface expended more effort in disciplining adulterous monks and clerical rapists than in bringing heathens to the baptismal font. A council at Aix-la-Chapelle in 836 denounced certain convents for practicing infanticide in order to dispose of the evidence of their inmates' sexual activities. With all these internal weaknesses and external pressures, no betting man would have wagered on the emergence from this threatened culture of a world-conquering Christian civilization. That such a civilization did emerge is thanks to three types of men: Celtic missionaries, Roman popes and Frankish kings.<br><br>Two religious currents--one from the north and one from the south--washed over Francia. Celtic spirituality was, and is, a very distinctive strain of religious experience. The conditions for its development and spread were restricted in both space and time. Like a diamond formed under intense pressure, it developed in a narrow cultural stratum sandwiched between the ancient rock of Celtic paganism and the new deposits of Anglo-Saxon paganism. The first native, British Christians built centers for the exercise of their highly disciplined routines of worship and meditation in the remoter parts of the remotest western province of what had been the Roman Empire. In the white heat of a spiritual commitment that refused to be obsessed with mere survival, they planned and launched ever more extensive evangelistic crusades. This, the first experience of Britain at the heart of Europe, was one of the most remarkable phases in the long history of Christian missionary endeavor, and its legends ring with the names of such heroes as Patrick, Columba, Aidan, Columban and Boniface. Most religious revivals peter out after a few decades. This one lasted in full vigor for an amazing four centuries, from the time when the last Roman conquerors departed to the moment when the first Viking invaders arrived. It would be impossible to overestimate the long-term effects of this religious explosion.<br><br>If we were to tease out from the multistranded life and teaching of these Celtic men and women (for women contemplatives always featured significantly within early British Christianity) a couple of features that help to explain their success, we might choose ones that seem, on the face of it, mutually contradictory. These saints manifested a strict puritanism allied with a flexibility toward pagan beliefs. On the one hand, they locked themselves in monastic "fortresses" such as Iona and Lindisfarne, where they could practice their austerities undisturbed; on the other, they pledged themselves to <i>peregrinatio</i>, wandering among strangers and unbelievers, protected only by the "breastplate" of faith, adumbrated by Patrick's famous hymn:<br><br> Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br><br> Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br><br> Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br><br> Christ to comfort and restore me,<br><br> Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br><br> Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br><br> Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br><br> Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.<br><br>Like itinerant holy men of all ages, the Celtic missionaries attracted curiosity and admiration. Numerous miracles were attributed to them. Yet in their preaching they did not exhort converts to commit themselves to the kind of renunciation and asceticism they followed themselves. They did not even demand unquestioning adherence to every tenet of Christian dogma and ethics.<br><br>One reason why Christianity has been the most successful of all world religions in crossing cultural boundaries is its adaptability. To be sure, this has not been manifested in all places and at all times. Some missionary endeavors have been based on the premise that any rival belief system is of the devil and must be totally obliterated. Contrariwise, there have been occasions when, for the sake of number crunching, religious fundamentals have been sacrificed. On the whole, however, wise evangelists have understood not only that the Gospel may be garbed in a variety of national costumes but that incorporating fresh customs and thought patterns actually enriches the life of new churches.<br><br>Celtic Christianity was itself an indigenous expression of "the faith once given" and not a carbon copy of the church life of Rome. Some of its customs were sharply at variance with what was culturally acceptable in Italy. It had married clergy and permitted women an active role in the liturgy--something anathema south of the Alps. Its organization focused on monastic cells rather than territorial dioceses. In fact, "organization" was scarcely a word in the vocabulary of these Celtic monks. They were dynamic missionaries, pilgrimaging throughout this world on their way to heaven. They had little time or inclination for establishing power bases.<br><br>Evangelistic strategy motivated their interaction with the prevailing cultures. They had found ways to mediate Christianity in terms that were deeply meaningful to the nature-worshipping instincts of their own and other people. Their pagan ancestors had made offerings to the gods of mountain spring and oaken grove, had prayed to the spirits residing in the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered for their healing properties. Men of the new faith, like St. Patrick, found ways to express their beliefs that were acceptable to a people living close to nature, without capitulating to pantheism:<br><br>Our God is the God of all men, the God of heaven and earth, of sea and river, of sun and moon and stars, of the lofty mountain and the lowly valley . . . He has his dwelling around heaven and earth and sea and all that in them is. He inspires all, he quickens all, he dominates all, he sustains all . . .(3)<br><br>It was in the scriptoria of the Celtic monasteries that the old sagas were written down for the first time and preserved alongside the Christian Scriptures and the lives of the saints. And the most familiar of all expressions of Celtic art, the great stone crosses, were a continuation of an ancient custom of erecting standing monuments carved with the symbols of the old religion.<br><br>While independent of power structures, the Celtic Christians could not avoid the realities of tribal government. Not only did they commend themselves to their own people and those of neighboring tribes by empathizing with their veneration of the mysteries of creation but they taught that their God was also interested in politics:<br><br>Tassilo, duke of the Bavarians . . . commended himself into vassalage with his lands, and swore innumerable oaths. Touching the relics of the saints, he promised fealty to King Pepin and his sons Charles and Carloman, behaving honestly and faithfully, in accordance with the law and as a vassal should to his lords. Tassilo thus swore on the bodies of St. Dionysius, Rusticus, Eleutherius, St. Germanus, and St. Martin that he would remain faithful all his life . . .(4)<br><br>Just as the spirits, whether pagan or Christian, manifested themselves through the physical universe, so they also did through the ordering of society. The hierarchy, like Jacob's ladder, extended from earth to heaven. At its base were slaves and landless peasants. From them one ascended through the ranks of warriors, aristocrats and princes to the domain of the shining ones--heroes and ancestors or, in the Christian pantheon, saints and angels thronging the throne room of the triune God. Theologians, preachers and artists presented the court of Christ the King in terms of the splendor of earthly monarchs, and the splendor of earthly monarchs in terms of th...</p><h2>The Spoils of War: Greed, Power, and the Conflicts That Made Our Greatest Presidents</h2><p><b>Two eminent political scientists show that America's great conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror, were fought not for ideals, or even geopolitical strategy, but for the individual gain of the presidents who waged them.</b><br><br>It's striking how many of the presidents Americans venerate-Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy, to name a few-oversaw some of the republic's bloodiest years. Perhaps they were driven by the needs of the American people and the nation. Or maybe they were just looking out for themselves.<br><br>This revealing and entertaining book puts some of America's greatest leaders under the microscope, showing how their calls for war, usually remembered as brave and noble, were in fact selfish and convenient. In each case, our presidents chose personal gain over national interest while loudly evoking justice and freedom. The result is an eye-opening retelling of American history, and a call for reforms that may make the future better.<br><br>Bueno de Mesquita and Smith demonstrate in compelling fashion that wars, even bloody and noble ones, are not primarily motivated by democracy or freedom or the sanctity of human life. When our presidents risk the lives of brave young soldiers, they do it for themselves.<br></p><p>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita is the Julius Silver Professor of Politics and director of the Alexander Hamilton Center for Political Economy at New York University.

An extraordinary episode in World War II, it describes the Zerzura Club, a group of desert explorers and adventurers who indulged in desert travel by early-model-motor cars and airplanes, and who searched for lost desert oases and ancient cities of vanished civilizations. In reality, they were mapping the desert for military reasons and espionage. The club's members came from countries that soon would be enemies: England and the Allied Forces v. Italy and Germany. When war erupted in 1939, Ralph Bagnold founded the British Long Range Desert Group to spy on and disrupt Rommel's advance on Cairo, while a fellow club member, Hungarian Count Almasy, succeeded in placing German spies there. Ultimately, the British prevailed. Saul Kelly's riveting history draws on interviews with survivors and previously unknown documentary material in England, Italy, Germany, Hungary, and Egypt. His book reads like a thriller &#x2013; with one key difference: it's all true.</p><p><b>Saul Kelly</b>is lecturer at King's College, London, specializing in the history of the Great Powers in Northern Africa. He has written several books, including <i>Cold War in the Desert</i> , and with Charles Douglas-Home, <i>Dignified and Efficient: The British Monarchy in the Twentieth Century</i> . He lives in London.Finally, a reliable popular account of The English Patient-era North African desert exploration, here from Kelly (Cold War in the Desert) who covers various expeditions, spies and war from 1920 to 1943 with accuracy and flair. The legendary oasis of Zerzura, and the lost ancient army of King Cambyses were huge draws for pre-WWII European expeditions to the area. British explorer Ralph Bagnold cuts a dashing figure, and there's much material on Hungarian desert explorer Lazlo Almasy, so rippingly played by Ralph Fiennes. Neither Zerzura nor Cambyses's army were found, although much evidence of prehistoric man in the area was discovered during these rival expeditions. Once the war began, the experience of seasoned explorers was utilized by both the British and Germans. Almasy worked for the Germans carrying out long-range intelligence missions behind enemy lines, by vehicle and aircraft: transporting espionage agents, carrying out acts of sabotage and tracking enemy movements. Firsthand accounts from a variety of sources are nicely blended into the narrative, which keeps the tension steady, but the book is heavy on operational mechanics.

A University of Tennessee graduate, Cabbage earned a master's degree in journalism from Stanford University.<p> <b>Chapter One: Re-Entry</b> </p><p> Looks like a blast furnace. </p><p> -- <i>Shuttle commander Rick Husband, midway through re-entry</i> </p><p> Plunging back to Earth after a 16-day science mission, the shuttle Columbia streaked through orbital darkness at 5 miles per second, fast enough to fly from Chicago to New York in two and a half minutes and to circle the entire planet in an hour and a half. For Columbia's seven-member crew, the only hint of the shuttle's enormous velocity was the smooth clockwork passage of entire continents far below. </p><p> Commander Rick Husband knew the slow-motion view was misleading, a trick of perspective and the lack of anything nearby to measure against the craft's swift passage. He knew the 117-ton shuttle actually was moving through space eight times faster than the bullet from an assault rifle, fast enough to fly the length of 84 football fields in a single heartbeat. </p><p> And Husband knew that in the next 15 minutes, the shuttle would shed the bulk of that unimaginable speed over the southwestern United States, enduring 3,000-degree temperatures as atmospheric friction converted forward motion into a hellish blaze of thermal energy. It had taken nearly 4 million pounds of rocket fuel to boost Columbia and its crew into orbital velocity. Now the astronauts were about to slam on the brakes. </p><p> For Husband, a devout Christian who put God and family ahead of his work as an astronaut, flying this amazing machine home from space was a near religious experience in its own right, one he couldn't wait to share with family and friends gathered at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. He had served as pilot on a previous shuttle flight, but this was his first as commander, and in the world of shuttle operations, it's the commander who actually lands the spacecraft. </p><p> He relished the opportunity. But his life as an astronaut took a backseat to his deep faith in God. Before blasting off on his second space flight as commander of Columbia, he videotaped 34 Bible lessons for his two kids, one each for the 17 days he would be away from home. </p><p> "The space shuttle is by far the most complex machine in the world," he had told his hometown church congregation three years earlier. "When you think about all the thousands of people it took to sit down and design this machine -- the main engines, auxiliary power units, the hydraulics, the flight control systems, the reaction control jets, the solid rocket boosters, the external tank that fuels the main engines, the crew compartment with all the controls and all the time that was spent to put this thing together and make it work -- it's to me inconceivable that you could take a look at the universe and think that it all just happened by accident. </p><p> "And inside that vehicle are seven astronauts, each one of which is more complex than this vehicle we went up in," he continued. "And God is an awesome God." </p><p> Looking over his cockpit instruments as he prepared Columbia for entry, the 45-year-old Air Force colonel chatted easily with his crewmates, coming across more as an older brother than as the skipper of a $3 billion spacecraft. But underneath the friendly camaraderie was the steady hand of a commander at ease with leadership and life-or-death responsibility. </p><p> "People have characterized him as a laid-back guy, easy-going," said entry flight director LeRoy Cain, who shared Husband's deep religious convictions. "But a lot of that was based in his faith, realizing our time here is limited and ultimately the real goal is to have that relationship with your maker. And he had that and he wanted to share that in a way that wasn't intrusive or offensive. And that's the biggest reason this crew gelled so well together." </p><p> Husband was also the first pilot since the astronaut class of 1984 to be given a shuttle command on his second mission. Kent Rominger, chief of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's astronaut corps and commander of Husband's first mission, said Husband "came out of that flight with a really strong reputation. Rick worked hard, did a really good job, was a great leader. He was a really gifted pilot." </p><p> So good, in fact, that data tapes charting his every move at the controls of NASA's shuttle training aircraft were frequently used to show other pilots how a textbook approach and landing should be flown. </p><p> <i>"This is Mission Control, Houston. Columbia's altitude is now 90 miles above the Pacific Ocean to the north of the Hawaiian Islands, about two minutes away from entering the Earth's atmosphere," said NASA commentator James Hartsfield, his words carried around the world by satellite over NASA's television network. "All activities continuing to go smoothly en route toward a touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center at 8:16 A.M. Central time."</i> </p><p> Getting to Columbia's flight deck hadn't been easy for Husband, who grew up dreaming about one day flying in space. </p><p> "I've wanted to be an astronaut all my life, ever since I was about four years old," he once said. "It was the only thing I could think about wanting to do." </p><p> So he planned his education and a military career with that single goal in mind. </p><p> After graduating from high school in 1975, the boy from Amarillo enrolled at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, a two-hour drive, where he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1980. There, he fell in love with Evelyn Neely, who, like Husband, had grown up in Amarillo. The two were married in their hometown at First Presbyterian Church. Now, 20 years later, the couple had two children, a 12-year-old daughter, Laura, and a 7-year-old son, Matthew. </p><p> The first seven years after his college graduation included an endless procession of Air Force bases, where he learned to fly the F-4 fighter and eventually became so good at it he was promoted to instructor. In 1987, he was assigned to the legendary test pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California's Mojave Desert. As an Amarillo schoolboy, he had built models of the flame-belching missiles that catapulted his heroes into orbit. Now, here at the same place where Chuck Yeager had broken the sound barrier, Husband proved he also had the right stuff. </p><p> But that wasn't enough. </p><p> By the time he arrived at Edwards, Husband already had applied to be an astronaut once and had been turned down. That was just prior to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger in 1986, and NASA ultimately canceled all new astronaut hires. Husband applied again afterward and was turned down a second time. Realizing NASA wanted astronaut candidates with advanced degrees, he went back to school at Fresno State University and earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering. The third time around, he got as far as the Johnson Space Center in Houston for a week of interviews and tests. Worried he might not pass the physical this time because of his eyesight, he wore contact lenses and lied about that on the application. He passed the physical, but again, the answer was no. </p><p> In the meantime, Husband drew an assignment as an exchange pilot with Britain's Royal Air Force in 1992 and shipped off to Boscombe Down, England, where he helped test a variety of new aircraft. He prayed for guidance on what he should do. </p><p> "God showed me that lying certainly was not the kind of thing that a Christian is supposed to do," he reflected in 2000. "When it came time for me to fill out the application a fourth time, I felt the strongest prompting from God to tell the truth. In studying the Bible more, I had come across Proverbs 3:5-6 that says, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.' </p><p> "It was as if God was saying 'Just trust me! You lied last time and didn't make it. Try telling the truth this time and see what happens.' Finally, I had come to the point where I understood what it meant to give my life to God and to trust Him. I said, 'OK, Lord. I want to do what You want me to do, and it doesn't matter if I'm an astronaut or something else.' " </p><p> This time he told the truth and was invited to begin training at Johnson in December 1994. But despite his obvious skills in the cockpit, it would be another five years before he was assigned to his first mission. Only two other members of the 20-member astronaut class known as Group 15 waited longer. </p><p> "A lot of people didn't know that Rick was one of the last people to fly in his class," said Dave Pitre, an astronaut trainer assigned to Columbia's mission. "And I don't know the reason why, because I think Rick's a great guy. But this is what I speculate. </p><p> "You look at his rï¿½sumï¿½ and he's the best. But he's so unassuming. And on the sixth floor [of the astronaut office], there's a lot of competition to be the best, to do the best. There's a lot of jockeying. Rick wouldn't do that, he never did that. He let his actions speak for himself. So he just sat there patiently in line and waited, and waited, and waited. I think he just wanted to make a statement and so they all tried just so hard, I mean, every training session you just got the feeling these guys were putting out 110 percent all the time. Everybody had something to prove on that flight and I think it just bonded them all together." </p><p> <i>"Columbia is currently targeted toward runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center; the runway selection continues to be discussed here in Mission Control, however. But for its approach to runway 33, Columbia will perform a right overhead turn to align with the runway of about 214 degrees."</i> </p><p> Preparations for the shuttle's arrival at Kennedy were in full swing. The landing support team, made up of engineers and technicians required to deactivate critical systems after touchdown, had gathered at dawn to go over their plans and to prepare their equipment. They were stationed at the northwest end of the broad, 3-mile-long Shuttle Landing Facility runway, expecting Columbia to come in from the southeast. </p><p> Shortly after sunrise, buses, limousines, and a fleet of sport-utility vehicles and government vans brought a crowd of VIPs, NASA managers, reporters, and invited guests to bleachers strung out on the eastern side of the Shuttle Landing Facility, about midway down the runway. Hartsfield's voice blared from loudspeakers mounted on telephone poles behind the bleachers, sounding clear in some areas but muffled in others. TV monitors, carrying NASA's television coverage of the landing, were spaced out in front of the bleachers, and a large countdown clock was ticking down toward touchdown. </p><p> The astronaut families were gathered at a lone set of bleachers at the northernmost end of the midfield viewing site, cordoned off from the other VIPs and guests to ensure a bit of privacy. An astronaut was assigned to each family to answer questions and to provide assistance in case of an emergency. </p><p> No problems were expected, and a triumphant homecoming was just minutes away. It was 8:44 A.M. on Feb. 1, 2003, and Columbia was descending through 400,000 feet northwest of Hawaii. </p><p> "OK, we're just past EI," Husband told his crewmates, marking when Columbia, flying wings level, its nose tilted up 40 degrees, finally fell into the discernible atmosphere. </p><p> He was referring to "entry interface," the moment the shuttle descended through an altitude of 76 miles. At that altitude -- 11 times higher than a typical passenger jet flies -- the atmosphere is still a vacuum in the everyday sense of the word. But enough atoms and molecules are present to begin having a noticeable effect on a vehicle plowing through them at 25 times the speed of sound. </p><p> Wearing bulky, bright orange pressure suits, Husband, rookie pilot William "Willie" McCool, flight engineer Kalpana Chawla (pronounced KULP'-nah CHAV'-lah), and Navy physician-astronaut Laurel Clark were strapped into their seats on Columbia's cramped flight deck, working through the final entries on a long checklist. </p><p> The shuttle's flight computers, each one taking in navigation data and plugging the numbers into long strings of equations, were doing the actual flying. Husband wouldn't take over manual control until the orbiter was on final approach, 50,000 feet above Kennedy. During this phase of entry, the astronauts were monitoring the ship's progress, discussing the view outside and making last-minute adjustments to their pressure suits. Husband and McCool had just finished drinking a final few bags of salty water in a somewhat unpleasant procedure known as "fluid loading." The concoction would make them less susceptible to feeling woozy during the onset of gravity after 16 days in weightlessness. </p><p> Husband was in the front left seat, the command position aboard any aircraft, with McCool to his right on the other side of a switch-studded instrument console. Chawla, a native of India, was a veteran of one previous shuttle flight and an accomplished pilot. Something of a legend in her hometown of Karnal in the Indian State of Punjab, Chawla was a role model in a country where less than half the women were literate. She sat directly behind the central console, calling out and double-checking re-entry tasks. Clark was seated to Chawla's right, almost touching shoulders with the diminutive flight engineer. </p><p> Strapped into seats on the split-level crew cabin's lower deck were payload commander Michael Anderson, another shuttle veteran and one of only a handful of African-American astronauts at NASA, physician-astronaut David Brown, a former circus acrobat, jet pilot and amateur videographer, and fighter pilot Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli to fly in space. </p><p> The crew was well aware of the high-risk nature of a shuttle flight. Like all astronauts, they had put their affairs in order before flying to Florida for the launch. Anderson, who attended the same Houston church as Husband, typified the tightly knit crew's feelings about personal safety. He told a former pastor not to be concerned if he didn't make it back from a mission. "Don't worry about me. I'm just going on higher." </p><p> High-risk missions were nothing new for Ramon. An impressive figure in the Israeli air force, he helped lead a daring 1981 Israeli bombing raid that reduced an unfinished Iraqi nuclear reactor to rubble. But he did not join Columbia's crew as a warrior. </p><p> "I represent, first of all, of course the state of Israel and the Jews," he said during an orbital interview a few days earlier. "But I represent also all our neighbors. And I hope it will contribute to the whole world and especially to our Middle East neighbors." </p><p> Unlike the upper flight deck with its wraparound airliner-type cockpit windows and large overhead view ports, the lower deck featured a single, small porthole in the shuttle's main hatch, almost out of view on the left side of the cabin. For Anderson, Brown and Ramon, there was nothing to see but rows of equipment lockers. At least they were plugged into the ship's intercom system, following along as the flight deck crew worked through the re-entry checklist. </p><p> They were listening in a half-hour earlier as Husband counted down to deorbit ignition, when Columbia's flight computers fired up the shuttle's twin braking rockets as the ...</p></p><h2>Sex Begins in the Kitchen: Creating Intimacy to Make Your Marriage Sizzle</h2><p>Now back with a fresh cover, new subtitle, and new introduction, <i>Sex Begins in the Kitchen</i> shows couples everywhere how to bring more passion into their marriages.

But what is Orientalism, and who were the Orientalists, and how did Western scholars of Islamic culture come to be vilified as insidious agents of European imperialism? In Robert Irwin&#x2019;s groundbreaking new history, he answers this question with a detailed and colorful story of the motley crew of intellectuals and eccentrics who brought an understanding of the Islamic world to the West. In a narrative that ranges from an analysis of Ancient Greek perceptions of the Persians to a portrait of the first Western European translators of Arabic to the contemporary Muslim world&#x2019;s perceptions of the Western study of Islam, Irwin affirms the value of the Orientalists&#x2019; legacy: not only for the contemporary scholars who have disowned it, but also for anyone committed to fostering the cross-cultural understanding which could bridge the real or imagined gulf between Islamic and Western civilization. Dangerous Knowledge is a both riveting and entertaining history, a bold argument, and an urgent redress of our conceptions about Western culture&#x2019;s relationship with its nearest neighbor.ROBERT IRWIN, the eminent Arabist, is the author of The Arabian Nightmare, Exquisite Corpse, Dangerous Knowledge, Prayer-Cushions of the Flesh, and The Limits of Vision.</p><h2>The Black Swan</h2><p>Set in the Civil War South between the years 1852 and 1865, THE BLACK SWAN recounts the story of two memorable and powerful characters.

Some genes, including those that shape our bodies, actually adapt to outside influences. In <i>Turn Off the Fat Genes</i>, Dr. Neal Barnard draws on this cutting-edge research to create a revolutionary new program for activating thin genes and suppressing fat genes, a dramatic tool for sculpting away excess pounds to reveal the healthy, vital body that nature intended.<br><br>In <i>Turn Off the Fat Genes</i>, Dr. Barnard begins by explaining the dynamics of nutrition and its impact on genetics. Once you understand how the genes that control your shape can be influenced, the next step is positive intervention. The heart of Dr. Barnard's book is a three-week gene-control program (complete with menus and recipes) specifically designed to influence the five key genes that determine: (1) which foods you prefer, (2) the strength of your appetite, (3) whether your calories are burned or stored as fat, (4) how fast you burn calories, and (5) your muscular type and ability to exercise. Dr. Barnard's program enables all of us to enjoy the same virtually effortless weight control as the naturally thin people we have always admired.</p><p>All of us have both "fat genes" that encourage weight gain and "thin genes" that tame the appetite, block fat storage, and increase metabolism, writes Neal Barnard, M.D., a clinical researcher in preventive medicine and president of the Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine. According to Barnard, scientific research reveals that "genes are not dictators; they are committees" when it comes to weight loss. His goal here is to teach you how to turn on the "thin genes" and turn off the "fat genes," using food, exercise, and other strategies.<p> Barnard introduces five key genetic influences on weight loss--all of which can be affected by diet: </p><ul> <li>Taste genes that determine which foods attract you<br> </li><li>Leptin, the gene that tames appetite when it's working right, and leads to overeating when it's not<br> </li><li>LPL, the enzyme storing fat in your cells<br> </li><li>Insulin, which can stimulate your fat burning or turn it off<br> </li><li>A gene for muscle-cell types that influences whether exercise is easy for you<br> </li></ul><p> Part 1 explains how each of these genetic influences works, how to figure out if and how much it affects you, and how to counter it. For example, you can boost a sluggish calorie burn with aerobic exercise and plant foods high in complex carbs and fiber. Part 2 argues the benefits of a "diet makeover" consisting of a vegan (pure vegetarian, no animal products), low-fat diet emphasizing whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits.</p><p> Part 3 offers menus and dozens of recipes from Jennifer Raymond. In case you think that eliminating meat and dairy would leave nothing substantial on your plate, you'll be pleasantly surprised by her varied, innovative, and satisfying recipes.

After all, a "random walk"--in market terms--suggests that a "blindfolded monkey" would have as much luck selecting a portfolio as a pro. But Burton Malkiel's classic investment book is anything but random. Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns.<p> First published in 1973, this seventh printing of a <i>A Random Walk</i> looks forward and does so broadly, examining a new range of investment choices facing the turn-of-the-century investor: money-market accounts, tax-exempt funds, Roth IRAs, and equity REITs, as well as the potential benefits and pitfalls of the emerging global economy. In his updated "life-cycle guide to investing," Malkiel offers age-related investment strategies that consider one's <i>capacity</i> for risk. (A 30-year-old who can depend on wages to offset investment losses has a different risk capacity from a 60-year-old.) In his assessment of rocketing Internet stocks, Malkiel defends his "random" position well, explaining how "the market eventually corrects any irrationality--albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But eventually, true value is recognized by the market, and this is the main lesson investors must heed." Written for the financial layperson but bolstered by 30 years of research, <i>A Random Walk</i> will help individual investors take charge of their financial future.

She explains the key roles mitochondria play in maintaining a healthy brain and body. Americans are eating so poorly, something we all know to be true, that the majority of Americans are missing key building blocks that are needed for brain cells to be healthy. The result is an epidemic of depression, aggression, multiple sclerosis and early dementia. She then teaches you how to eat for healthy mitochondria, a healthy brain and a healthy body in language that is clear and concise, even for those without a science background. In this book, Dr. Wahls explains basic brain biology in simple terms. She tells us what vitamin, mineral and essential fat building blocks are needed by the mitochondria and other key structures in the brain. Then she explains what foods are good sources for those key nutrients. Over a hundred recipes are provided to help get you started on this new way of eating. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of this book will be used to fund research into the benefits of these interventions in others.</p><p>Her body ravaged by secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, Dr. Terry Wahls spent nearly four years dependent upon a tilt-recline wheelchair. Now, thanks to the intensive, directed nutrition and neuromuscular electrical stimulation protocols she developed, Dr. Wahls now rides her bicycle to work. She has brought together an interdisciplinary team to conduct clinical trials using intensive, directed nutrition and neuromuscular electrical stimulation to combat advanced Parkinson&#39;s disease and secondary and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. She is a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Iowa where she sees teaches residents and medical students in primary care and rounds in traumatic brain injury clinics. She is also committed to helping the public learn about the connection between the foods we eat and the health we have or do not have and lectures nationally and regionally on the use of intensive, directed nutrition to restore health. The Food as Medicine lecture series hosted by the Kirkwood Community College and New Pioneer Food Cooperative has transformed the lives of many people. Terry lives in Iowa City with her spouse, Jackie, and has two children.</p><h2>Entangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific</h2><p><p><i>Entangled Objects</i> threatens to dislodge the cornerstone of Western anthropology by rendering permanently problematic the idea of reciprocity. All traffic, and commerce, whether economic or intellectual, between Western anthropologists and the rest of the world, is predicated upon the possibility of establishing reciprocal relations between the West and the indigenous peoples it has colonized for centuries.</p><p>Drawing on his work on contemporary postcolonial Pacific societies, Nicholas Thomas takes up three issues central to modern anthropology: the cultural and political dynamics of colonial encounters, the nature of Western and non-Western transactions (such as the gift and the commodity), and the significance of material objects in social life. Along the way, he raises doubts about any simple &#x201c;us/them&#x201d; dichotomy between Westerners and Pacific Islanders, challenging the preoccupation of anthropology with cultural difference by stressing the shared history of colonial entanglement.</p><p>Thomas integrates general issues into a historical discussion of the uses Pacific Islanders and Europeans have made of each other&#x2019;s material artifacts. He explores how nineteenth- and twentieth-century islanders, and visitors from the time of the Cook voyages up to the present day, have fashioned identities for themselves and each other by appropriating and exchanging goods. Previous writers have explored museums and the tribal art market, but this is the first book to concentrate on the distinct interests of European collectors and the islanders. In its comparative scope, its combination of historical and ethnographic scholarship, and its subversive approach to anthropological theory and traditional understandings of colonial relationships, <i>Entangled Objects</i> is a unique and challenging book. It will be tremendously interesting to all those working in the fields of cultural studies, from history to literature.</p></p><p></p><h2>Magicians of the Gods: The Forgotten Wisdom of Earth&#39;s Lost Civilisation - the Sequel to Fingerprints of the Gods</h2><p>Brand New Book.

Tracking whenever available.</p><p>As East Africa correspondent of The Economist in the early eighties Graham Hancock began to write a series of highly acclaimed books on economics, politics and foreign aid. His life took a whole new turn when he became fascinated by rumours that the Ark of the Covenant is real artefact, hidden somewhere in northern Africa. The story of his detective work, tracking it down to its supposed final resting place became the international bestseller The Sign and the Seal (now in production as a feature film.) More bestsellers in the field of &#39;alternative history&#39; followed, including Fingerprints of the Gods, Keeper of Genesis (the latter co-authored with Robert Bauval) and Heaven&#39;s Mirror. In Supernatural he described his experiences journeying to experiment with hallucinogenic drugs amongst tribes people for whom they represent a gateway into supernatural realms. His ideas on exploring new dimensions in consciousness became the subject of his controversial TED talks. Graham Hancock&#39;s books have been translated into twenty-seven languages and have sold over nine million copies worldwide. His public lectures and broadcasts, including two major TV series for Channel 4, Quest for the Lost Civilisation, and Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age, have further established his reputation as an unconventional thinker who raises controversial questions about humanity`s past.Hancock&#39;s book is an absorbing big-picture analysis as well as a cautionary tale. * Nexus Magazine * A great yarn...

From the earliest examples of the genre in the nineteenth century to today's digital revolution, Robert Elwall focuses on the changing aesthetic of the medium worldwide. Included are such topics as the early influence of architectural drawing; the growth of specialist photographic firms documenting the nineteenth-century building boom; the influence of photography on both architectural practice and history; the invention of half-tone reproduction; the role of photography in the spread of Modernism; the impact of colour photography during the 1970s and 1980s; and the increasing use of computers to shape a new direction.<br>Authoritatively written by a world-renowned expert and illustrated with images from collections throughout the world, this study is essential reading for anyone interested in architecture, photography and the history of their special relationship.</p><p>Robert Elwall is Photographs Curator at the British Architectural Library, Royal Institute of British Architects, London.</p><h2>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</h2><p>In the first volume of an extraordinary autobiographical series, one of the most inspiring authors of our time recalls--with candor, humor, poignancy and grace--how her journey began....</p><p>In this first of five volumes of autobiography, poet Maya Angelou recounts a youth filled with disappointment, frustration, tragedy, and finally hard-won independence. Sent at a young age to live with her grandmother in Arkansas, Angelou learned a great deal from this exceptional woman and the tightly knit black community there. These very lessons carried her throughout the hardships she endured later in life, including a tragic occurrence while visiting her mother in St. Louis and her formative years spent in California--where an unwanted pregnancy changed her life forever. Marvelously told, with Angelou&#39;s &#34;gift for language and observation,&#34; this &#34;remarkable autobiography by an equally remarkable black woman from Arkansas captures, indelibly, a world of which most Americans are shamefully ignorant.&#34;"This testimony from a black sister marks the beginning of a new era in the minds and hearts of all black men and women... <i>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</i>, liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity. I have no words for this achievement, but I know that not since the days of my childhood, when the people in books were more real than the people one saw every day, have I found myself so moved... Her portrait is a biblical study in life in the midst of death." -- James Baldwin <p>"Simultaneously touching and comic" -- <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>"It is a heroic and beautiful book." -- <i>Clevland Plain Dealer</i></p><p>"Maya Angelou is a natural writer with an inordinate sense of life and she has written and exceptional autobiographical narrative... a beautiful book -- an unconditionally involving memoir for our time or any time." -- <i>The Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>H.R.H.</h2><p>In a novel where ancient traditions conflict with reality and the pressures of modern life, a young European princess proves that simplicity, courage, and dignity win the day and forever alter her world.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>In blue jeans and a pullover, Princess Christianna is a young woman of her times: born in Europe, educated in America, worried about the future of the world she lives in, responsible beyond her years. Christianna is the only daughter of the Reigning Prince of a European nation that takes its royalty seriously&#x2013;and her father has ironclad plans for Christianna&#x2019;s life, a burden that is almost unbearable.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Now, after four years at Berkeley, life in her father&#x2019;s palace cannot distract Christianna from what she sees outside the kingdom&#x2013;the suffering of children, the ravages of terrorism and disease. Determined to make a difference in the world, she persuades His Royal Highness, her father, to let her volunteer for the Red Cross in East Africa. And for Christianna, a journey of discovery, change, and awakening begins.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Under a searing East African sun, Christianna plunges into the dusty, bustling life of an international relief camp, finding a passion and a calling among the brave doctors and volunteers. Finally free from the scrutiny of her royal life, Christianna struggles to keep her identity a secret from her new friends and coworkers&#x2013;even from Parker Williams, the young doctor from Doctors Without Borders who works alongside Christianna and shares her dedication to healing. But as violence approaches and invades the camp, and the pressures of her royal life beckon her home, Christianna&#x2019;s struggle for freedom takes an extraordinary turn. By a simple twist of fate, in one shocking moment, Christianna&#x2019;s life is changed forever&#x2013;in ways she never could have foreseen.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>From the splendor of a prince&#x2019;s palace to the chaos of war-torn nations, Danielle Steel takes us into fascinating new worlds. Filled with unforgettable images and a remarkable cast of characters, <b>H.R.H.</b> is a novel of the conflict between old and new worlds, responsibility versus freedom, and duty versus love.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 570 million copies of her novels sold.

She is also the author of <b>His Bright Light</b><i>,</i> the story of her son Nick Traina&#x2019;s life and death.<i>Chapter One<br> </i><br> <br> Christianna stood at her bedroom window, looking down at the hillside in the pouring rain. She was watching a large white dog, soaking wet with matted hair, digging excitedly in the mud. Every now and then he would look up at her and wag his tail, and then return to digging again. He was the Great Pyrenees her father had given her eight years before. His name was Charles, and in many ways he was her best friend. She laughed as she watched him chase a rabbit that eluded him and promptly disappeared. Charles barked frantically and then splashed happily through the mud again, looking for something else to pursue. He was having a great time, as Christianna was, watching him. It was the last of summer and the weather was still warm. She had returned to Vaduz in June, after four years of college in Berkeley. Coming home had been something of a shock, and so far the best thing about her homecoming was Charles. Other than her cousins in England and Germany, and acquaintances throughout Europe, her only friend was Charles. She led a sheltered and isolated life, and always had. It seemed unlikely she would see her Berkeley friends again.<br> <br> As she watched the dog disappear toward the stables, Christianna hurried out of her room, intent on going outside and following him. She grabbed her riding slicker and a pair of rubber boots she used to muck out her horse's stall, and ran down the back stairs. She was grateful that no one noticed her, and a moment later she was outside, sliding through the mud and running after the big white dog. She called his name, and in an instant he bounded up to her, nearly knocking her down. He wagged his tail, splashing water everywhere, put a muddy paw on her, and when she bent to stroke him, he reached up and licked her face, and then ran away again as she laughed. Together, they ran side by side along the bridle path. It was too wet today to ride.<br> <br> When the dog strayed from the path, she called his name, he hesitated only for an instant, and then came back to her each time. He was normally well behaved, but the rain excited him, as he ran and barked. Christianna was having as much fun as the dog. After nearly an hour, slightly out of breath, she stopped, the dog panting heavily beside her. She took a shortcut then, and half an hour later, they were once again back where they began. It had been a wonderful outing for both mistress and dog, and each looked as disreputable and disheveled as the other. Christianna's long, almost white-blond hair was matted to her head, her face was wet, and even her eyelashes were stuck together. She never wore makeup, unless she had to go out or was likely to be photographed, and she was wearing the jeans she had brought back from Berkeley. They were a souvenir of her lost life. She had loved every moment of her four years at UC Berkeley. She had fought hard to be allowed to go. Her brother had gone to Oxford, and her father had suggested the Sorbonne for her. Christianna had been adamant about going to college in the States, and her father had finally relented, though reluctantly. Going that far from home spelled freedom to her, and she had reveled in each day she was there, and had hated to come home when she graduated in June. She had made friends she missed sorely now, they were part of another life she missed so much. She had come home to face her responsibilities, and do what was expected of her. To Christianna, it felt like a heavy burden, lightened only by moments such as these, running through the woods with her dog. The rest of the time since coming home, she had felt as though she were in prison, serving a life sentence. There was no one she could have said that to, and doing so would have made her sound ungrateful for all she had. Her father was extremely kind to her. He had sensed, more than seen, her sadness since returning from the States. But there was nothing he could do about it. Christianna knew as well as he did that her childhood, and the freedom she had enjoyed in California, had come to an end.<br> <br> Charles looked up at his mistress questioningly as they reached the end of the bridle path, as though asking her if they really had to go back.<br> <br> "I know," Christianna said softly, patting him, "I don't want to either." The rain felt gentle on her face, and she didn't mind getting soaked, or her long blond mane getting wet, any more than the dog did. The slicker protected her, and her boots were caked with mud. She laughed as she looked at him, thinking it was hard to believe that this muddy brown dog was really white.<br> <br> She needed the exercise, as did the dog. He wagged his tail as he looked at her, and then with a slightly more decorous step, they walked home. She was hoping to slip in the back door, but getting Charles into the house, in his disreputable condition, would be a greater challenge. He was too filthy to take upstairs, and she knew she would have to take him in through the kitchen. He was in desperate need of a bath after their muddy walk.<br> <br> She opened the kitchen door quietly, hoping to escape attention for as long as possible, but as soon as she opened it, the enormous muddy dog bounded past her, dashed into the middle of the room, and barked with excitement. So much for a quiet entrance, Christianna smiled ruefully, and glanced apologetically at the familiar faces around her. The people who worked in her father's kitchen were always kind to her, and sometimes she wished that she could still sit among them, enjoying their company and the friendly atmosphere, as she had as a child. But those days were over for her as well. They no longer treated her as they had when she and her brother Friedrich were children. Friedrich was ten years older than she, and was traveling in Asia for the next six months. Christianna had turned twenty-three that summer.<br> <br> Charles was still barking and, shaking the water off enthusiastically, had splattered nearly everyone around him with mud, as Christianna tried vainly to subdue him.<br> <br> "I'm so sorry," she said as Tilda, the cook, wiped her face with her apron, shook her head, and smiled good naturedly at the young woman she had known since birth. She signaled quickly to a young man, who rushed to lead the dog away. "I'm afraid he got awfully dirty," Christianna said with a smile to the young man, wishing she could bathe the dog herself. She liked doing it, but she knew it was unlikely they would let her. Charles yelped unhappily as he was led away. "I don't mind bathing him . . . ," Christianna said, but the dog was already gone.<br> <br> "Of course not, ma'am," Tilda said, frowning at her, and then used a clean towel to wipe Christianna's face as well. If Christianna had still been a child, she would have scolded her and told her that she looked worse than the dog. "Would you like some lunch?" Christianna hadn't even thought of it, and shook her head. "Your father is still in the dining room. He just finished his soup. I could send something up for you." Christianna hesitated, and then nodded. She hadn't seen him all day, and she enjoyed the quiet moments they shared when he wasn't working, and had a few minutes to himself, which was rare. He was usually surrounded by assorted members of his staff, and was in a rush to get to meetings. It was a treat for him to enjoy a meal alone, especially with her. She cherished the time they spent together. The only reason she had willingly come home from Berkeley was for him. There had been no other choice, although she would have loved to go on to graduate school just so she could stay in the States. She didn't dare ask. She knew the answer would have been no. Her father wanted her at home. She knew she had to be doubly responsible because her brother wasn't at all. If Friedrich had been willing to shoulder his responsibilities, it would have lightened the burden on her. But there was no hope of that.<br> <br> She left her slicker hanging on a peg outside the kitchen, and took off her boots. They were noticeably smaller than any other pair there. She had tiny feet, and was so small she was almost a miniature. In flat shoes, her brother often teased her that she looked like a little girl, particularly with her long blond hair, which was still hanging wet down her back. She had small delicate hands, a perfect figure nothing like a child's, although she was very slight and always just a little bit too thin, and a face like a cameo. People said she looked like her mother, and somewhat like her father, who was as fair as she was, although both he and her brother were very tall, well over six feet. Christianna's mother had been as small as she was and had died when Christianna was five, and Friedrich was fifteen. Their father had never remarried. Christianna was the lady of the house, and was often her father's hostess now at important dinners or events. It was one of the responsibilities expected of her, and although she didn't enjoy it, it was a duty she performed lovingly for him. She and her father had always been extremely close. He had always been sensitive to the fact that it had been hard for her growing up without a mother. And in spite of his many duties, he had made every effort to be both father and mother to her, not always an easy task.<br> <br> Christianna bounded up the back stairs in jeans, sweater, and stocking feet. She arrived in the pantry slightly breathless, nodded at the people there, and slipped quietly into the dining room. Her father was sitting at the dining table alone, poring over a stack of papers, wearing his glasses, with a serious look on his face. He didn't hear Christianna come in. He glanced up and smiled as she slipped silently in to the chair beside him. He was obviously pleased to see his daughter, he always was.<br> <br> "What have you been up to, Cricky?" He had called her that since she was a little girl. He gently patted her head as she leaned over to kiss him, and he noticed her wet hair. "You've been out in the rain. Were you riding in this weather?"

In 1741, hungry explorers discovered herds of Steller&#x2019;s sea cow in the Bering Strait, and in less than thirty years, the amiable beast had been harpooned into extinction. It&#x2019;s a classic story, but a key fact is often omitted. Bering Island was the last redoubt of a species that had been decimated by hunting and habitat loss years before the&nbsp;explorers set sail.<br><br> As Callum M. Roberts reveals in <i>The Unnatural History of the S</i>ea, the oceans&#x2019; bounty didn&#x2019;t disappear overnight. While today&#x2019;s fishing industry is ruthlessly efficient, intense exploitation began not in the modern era, or even with the dawn of industrialization, but in the eleventh century in medieval Europe. Roberts explores this long and colorful history of commercial fishing, taking readers around the world and through the centuries to witness the transformation of the seas.<br><br> Drawing on firsthand accounts of early explorers, pirates, merchants, fishers, and travelers, the book recreates the oceans of the past: waters teeming with whales, sea lions, sea otters, turtles, and giant fish. The abundance of marine life described by fifteenth century seafarers is almost unimaginable today, but Roberts both brings it alive and artfully traces its depletion. Collapsing fisheries, he shows, are simply the latest chapter in a long history of unfettered commercialization of the seas.<br><br> The story does not end with an empty ocean. Instead, Roberts describes how we might restore the splendor and prosperity of the seas through smarter management of our resources and some simple restraint. From the coasts of Florida to New Zealand, marine reserves have fostered spectacular recovery of plants and animals to levels not seen in a century. They prove that history need not repeat itself: we can leave the oceans richer than we found them.</p><p><p>Callum M. Roberts is professor of marine conservation at the University of York in England. He is a prolific author and researcher, and has advised the U.S., British, and Caribbean governments on the creation of marine reserves. </p><p></p><p></p>"His impressive book, replete with quotations from the reports of early explorers, merchants and travelers describing seas teeming with life that's unimaginable today, is a vivid reminder of what we've lost and a plea to save what is left and help the sea recover some of its earlier bounty." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"[Callum] Roberts's book is invaluable, not to mention deeply disturbing." (Jonathan Yardley's 10 best books of the year, "The Washington Post Book World")<br><br>"Passionate and immensely important book . . . ."

Thank you, too, for inspiring hope that we still have a chance to reverse the disastrous decline of the ocean, and thus secure our own future, as well as that of fish, whales and clams."

(<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>"Out of sight, out of mind&#x2014;the wholesale destruction of marine life under the waves by an increasingly rapacious fishing industry has largely gone unnoticed. This eloquent and inspiring book not only reveals the true extent of this loss but also tells of the oceans' amazing powers of regeneration. A long-time advocate for setting aside large areas of ocean as marine reserves and allowing nature to do her own thing, Professor Roberts makes the case crystal clear as to why politicians and society as a whole must act now if we are to save our oceans and the beauty and the bounty they contain." (Richard Page, Greenpeace)<br><br>"The accounts presented in <i>The Unnatural History of the Sea</i> provide compelling comparison benchmarks and expose the harm done by mankind's continued view of wildlife solely as commodity." (<i>Honolulu Advertiser</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Unnatural History of the Sea</i> is not just another lament over bygone environmental conditions. Roberts highlights the value of conservation efforts, such as marine reserves (areas off-limits to fishing), reminding readers that an awareness of history is essential to designing such programs." (<i>Audubon</i>)<br><br>"Roberts is eloquent and persuasive as he recounts centuries of ill-managed fishery planning, and allows those who have directly experienced dramatic changes in the oceans to speak for themselves....Thoughtful, inspiring, devastating, and powerful, Roberts' comprehensive, welcoming, and compelling approach to an urgent subject conveys large problems in a succinct and involving manner.

Men don't like to go hungry, they don't like to live on salads, they don't like excluding food groups and they don't like counting calories.The Eat-Clean Diet for Men allows men to lose weight and get healthy while freeing them from all those dieting evils!</p><p></p><h2>The Homecoming; A Novel About Spencer&#39;s Mountain.</h2><p>Relates a young boy&#39;s humorous and unexpected adventures while searching through the snowbound hills of Virginia for his father</p><p><b>Earl Hamner Jr.</b> was born in Schuyler, a village in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.

Jan Morris shows clearly the manners of thought of the Welch people, as well as their art, their landscapes and their folklore, their ways of earning a living, their character, their meaning and their historical destiny. Half Welsh, half English herself, Morris is a historian, a travel writer, and an essayist. All three disciplines she brings to this work--a vivid tribute to a country not just on the map or in the mind but also in the heart. "All of us," Morris writes, "have some small country there."<br><br>"A dense, poetic, richly textured account of a land and a culture, passionate and extravagant in both location and spirit, almost hymnlike."--Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Ranks among her best books...the writing sparkles."--The New York Times<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>Jan Morris is the author of such books as the Pax Britannica trilogy, Spain, Destinations, and most recently, Journeys.<br><br>"With this book Morris joins the immortals. The splendors of the prose are, like Homer's sea, simply everywhere. She is an absolute master of the sentence."--Christian Science Monitor</p><p></p><h2>Love That Dog</h2><p><p>"I guess it does<br>look like a poem<br>when you see it<br>typed up<br>like that."</p><p>Jack hate poetry. Only girls write it and every time he tries to, his brain feels empty. But his teacher, Ms. Stretchberry, won't stop giving her class poetry assignments -- and Jack can't avoid them. But then something amazing happens. The more he writes, the more he learns he does have something to say.</p>With a fresh and deceptively simple style, acclaimed author Sharon Creech tells a story with enormous heart. Written as a series of free-verse poems from Jack's point of view, <em>Love That Dog</em> shows how one boy finds his own voice with the help of a teacher, a writer, a pencil, some yellow paper, and of course, a dog.</p><p>Newbery Medal winner Sharon Creech's <i>Love That Dog</i>, a funny, sweet, original short novel written in free verse, introduces us to an endearingly unassuming, straight-talking boy who discovers the powers and pleasures of poetry. Against his will. After all, "boys don't write poetry. Girls do." What does he say of the famous poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"? "I think Mr. Robert Frost / has a little / too / much / time / on his / hands." As his teacher, Ms. Stretchberry, introduces the canon to the class, however, he starts to see the light. Poetry is not so bad, it's not just for girls, and it's not even that hard to write. Take William Carlos Williams, for example: "If that is a poem / about the red wheelbarrow / and the white chickens / then any words / can be a poem. / You've just got to / make / short / lines." He becomes more and more discerning as the days go by, and readers' spirits will rise with Jack's as he begins to find his own voice through his own poetry and through that of others. His favorite poem of all is a short, rhythmic one by Walter Dean Myers called "Love That Boy" (included at the end of the book with all the rest of Ms. Stretchberry's assignments). The words completely captivate him, reminding him of the loving way his dad calls him in the morning and of the way he used to call his yellow dog, Sky. Jack's reverence for the poem ultimately leads to meeting the poet himself, an experience he will never forget.<p> This winning, accessible book is truly remarkable in that Creech lets us witness firsthand how words can open doors to the soul. And this from a boy who asks, "Why doesn't the person just / keep going if he's got / so many miles to go / before he sleeps?"

In this collection, acclaimed storyteller Tim Tingle tells the stories of his people, the Choctaw People, the Okla Homma. For years, Tim has collected stories of the old folks, weaving traditional lore with stories from everyday life. <i>Walking the Choctaw Road </i>is a mixture of myth stories, historical accounts passed from generation to generation, and stories of Choctaw people living their lives in the here and now.<p></p><p>The Wordcraft Circle of Native American Writers and Storytellers selected Tim as "Contemporary Storyteller Of The Year" for 2001, and in 2002, Tim was the featured storyteller at the National Storyteller Festival in Jonesboro, Tennessee.</p><p><b>Tim Tingle </b>lives in Canyon Lake, Texas.</p></p><p>In considering which stories to include in Walking the Choctaw Road, a primary consideration was the question, "What is Choctaw?" I chose to include stories that, in my estimation, best reflect the history and beliefs of the Choctaws: members of the Oklahoma Choctaw Nation and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Seen as a body, the narratives hopefully will give the reader a sense of what it is to be Choctaw, and why the Choctaws have operated so successfully in mainstream American society. <p>In collecting Choctaw stories, I have done so as an independent endeavor, seeking out friends and relatives of friends. I have listened to stories told by total strangers in locations as diverse as the waiting room of the Choctaw Health Center in Talihina, Oklahoma, and the old tribal graveyard at the capitol grounds in Tuskahoma. I have been honored to enter the homes of older Choctaws who knew they were near death and who probably considered the interview as something of a summation of their life story.</p>From JOSEPH BRUCHAC, author of TELL ME A TALE: For a good many years now, Tim Tingle has been one of my favorite American storytellers. Invariably, his narratives honor the Choctaw traditions of his ancestors. Yet they are told with such poetic clarity that any good listener, whether Indian or not, will feel invited into that world, a place of memory and song, courage, magical reality, and the extraordinary lives of everyday folks. Delivered in Tim&#x2019;s quiet, down-home Indian voice, they&#x2019;re the sort of lesson stories that stick to you like a burr. <p>The good news for readers is that these written versions of Tim&#x2019;s tales lose none of the gentle intensity of his memorable oral tellings. Their subjects range from the Trail of Tears to memories of his own childhood. They run the gamut from magical narratives of shape-shifters and escaping slaves seeking refuge among the Choctaws to an elder&#x2019;s recollections of finding friendship in the bitter barracks of an Indian boarding school. Walking the Choctaw Road, like one of those old Choctaw chants that kept the people&#x2019;s feet going along the long journey, will stay with you and lend you some of its strength. Cross the river with these stories&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll give you safe passage.</p></p><h2>Fly By Wire (A Jammer Davis Thriller)</h2><p>With its revolutionary fly-by-wire technology, the C-500 had become the freight airframe of choice.

Zucker turns her intelligent eye outward and inward, including everything she knows about mothers, stories, poems, and consequence itself. In mythic terms, the essay is about a poet who doesn't want to turn into a storyteller.

Bookseller since 1995 (LL-Base2BS-2-middle-R) rareviebooks</p><p>Text: French, GermanLouis's huge color-field paintings are modern icons. Long streaks of pure color jostle against each other, creating new energies. In his "Unfurled" series, the sheer emptiness of the center of the canvas makes the few draped color lines seem like heroic acts of triumph over nothingness. His gauze-like, lyrical "Veils" are bursting with potentiality, yet not of this world. In Elderfield, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, Louis has found the ideal interpreter. His minute analyses of how the viewer responds to a Louis painting give full attention to their poetic and even spiritual qualities, their roots in Symbolism, their associations with light, air, fire and water. This catalogue of a traveling exhibition makes a convincing case for the view that Louis wedded Mediterranean flatness to glaring American light in works of curious power and intensity. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality: Self-Study Guide for Personal Transformation (Book and MP3 edition)</h2><p>Heal yourself &amp; Mother Earth!<p> Join Maureen St. Germain for an exciting, breakthrough book -- <b><i>Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality</i></b> gives you personal tools to evolve as a healer or self-evolving individual.

Witty, charming, and an ardent lover of women, Russia's greatest dramatist was also coolly detached, capable of capriciousness and considerable cruelty.

Long ago, the ungifted pledged fealty and service to her family in exchange for safe haven, and a kingdom was carved out from the wildlands and sustained by magic capable of repelling the world&#x2019;s deadliest foes. As the sole heir of Pavan, Aurora's been groomed to be the perfect queen. She&#x2019;s intelligent and brave and honorable. But she&#x2019;s yet to show any trace of the magic she&#x2019;ll need to protect her people.</p><p>To keep her secret and save her crown, Aurora&#x2019;s mother arranges for her to marry a dark and brooding Stormling prince from another kingdom. At first, the prince seems like the perfect solution to all her problems. He&#x2019;ll guarantee her spot as the next queen and be the champion her people need to remain safe. But the more secrets Aurora uncovers about him, the more a future with him frightens her. When she dons a disguise and sneaks out of the palace one night to spy on him, she stumbles upon a black market dealing in the very thing she lacks&#x2015;storm magic. And the people selling it? They&#x2019;re not Stormlings. They&#x2019;re storm <i>hunters</i>.</p><p>Legend says that her ancestors first gained their magic by facing a storm and stealing part of its essence.

She might not have magic now, but she can steal it if she&#x2019;s brave enough. </p><p><i>Challenge a tempest. Survive it. And you become its master.</i></p></p><p>Cora Carmack is a New York Times and USA Today bestselling author. Since she was a teenager, her favorite genre to read has been fantasy, and now she's thrilled to bring her usual compelling characters and swoon-worthy romance into worlds of magic and intrigue with her debut YA fantasy, <i>Roar</i>. Her previous adult romance titles include the Losing It, Rusk University, and Muse series. Her books have been translated into more than a dozen languages around the world. Cora splits her time between Austin, TX and New York City, and on any given day you might find her typing away at her computer, flying to various cities around the world, or just watching Netflix with her kitty Katniss. But she can always be found on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and her website coracarmack.com.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;Princess Aurora is the only heir to the Pavan throne. She was born a Stormling, the youngest member of a family whose line carries the magic necessary to defeat the destructive magical storms that threaten her country during the Rage season. But Rora hides a terrible secret: she was born without the storm-fighting gifts. Now the young woman is faced with a marriage to a man who does not love her&#x2014;but whose Stormling talents are meant to cover for her own lack. She strikes out to make her own way in the world and gives herself a new name: Roar. In the world of YA fantasy, Rora's lack of talent is a welcome change and allows the character's will and intelligence to take center stage. Carmack's background as a romance writer is evident in Rora's slow-burning scenes with her betrothed, Cassius, and her fellow storm-chaser Locke, but her prose is denser than that of many of her YA contemporaries. The story moves at a more leisurely pace; this book will appeal primarily to hard-core fantasy fans, although lovers of romance may also find a lot to enjoy.

Was Israel&#x2019;s first king Saul a hero or a disaster? Was David a highly gifted leader and accomplished king or a murderer and a cheat? Did Solomon preside over the most glorious epoch in Israelite history or did he lead the nation into a fateful decline? Knoppers show how the Bible itself contains a variety of fascinating perspectives on major events and characters. One of the most misunderstood books of the Bible, Chronicles presents a distinctive and important viewpoint on much of Israel&#x2019;s past, especially the monarchy. Knoppers shows how Chronicles defends the transition from Saul to David and upholds the Davidic-Solomonic monarchy as a time of incomparable Israelite achievement and glory, a period in which the nation&#x2019;s most important public institutions&#x2014;the Davidic dynasty, the Jerusalem Temple, the priests, and the Levites&#x2014;took formative shape.<br><br><i>I Chronicles 10-29</i>, part of a two-volume set on I Chronicles, is the first to employ systematically the witness of the Dead Sea Scrolls to reconstruct the biblical author&#x2019;s text. Knoppers shows how Chronicles is related to and creatively drawn from many earlier biblical books and presents a fascinating look at its connections in both compositional style and approach to historical writings attested in ancient Mesopotamia and classical Greece.</p></p><p><p>Gary N.

With the verisimilitude that's a hallmark of his writing, Dunning delves into a new topic, the golden days of radio, igniting the reader's excitement about the enormous potential of the medium. Sadly, he can't assuage the inevitable disappointment over how that potential was wasted: <blockquote>"Radio is the greatest invention of the past four centuries. It ranks right up there with Gutenberg's movable type as an earthshaking force.... One of the first things Gutenberg did with his movable type was print a magnificent Bible. The first thing radio did was argue how much selling would be permitted and how ridiculous it would be allowed to get. If it keeps on the way it's going there won't be anything worth listening to.... I have this almost morbid fear of the future--not that radio's greatest days will fade away but that its greatest day will never come. Fifty years from now it could just be a medium of hucksters and fools, a whorehouse in the sky."</blockquote> The speaker is Jack Dulaney, a novelist who follows a dead man's trail to the Jersey shore in the early days of World War II, where a radio station owned by a recluse has fallen on hard times. The mysterious Harford, who built the station as a showcase for his late wife's ambition, has all but abandoned WHAR, but the actors, writers, producers, and technicians who once shared the dead woman's dream are galvanized by the appearance of Dulaney, who finds his true mï¿½tier in the creation of original, politically provocative broadcast dramas. He also discovers true love in a talented young singer, Holly Carnahan, whose affections he once sacrificed out of loyalty to his best friend. <p> Carnahan's search for her missing father involves Dulaney in a mystery rooted in the long-ago Boer War that has grown into a conspiracy peopled by German saboteurs, Irish nationalists, and African freedom fighters. The plotting is dense and the cast of minor characters merely sketched, but Dulaney's creative process is artfully drawn and the ambience of America in wartime is skillfully portrayed. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>John Dunning</b>is the Nero Wolfe Award-winning author of <i>Booked to Die</i> and <i>The Bookman's Wake,</i> a <i>New York Times</i> notable book of 1995.

At first refusing to let go, desperate to feel the presence of her friend, the poet seeks solace in a belief in the spirit world. But life, not death, becomes the issue when she begins to see physical existence as "an interruption" that preoccupies us with shapes and borders. "Shape makes life too small," she realizes. Comfort at last comes in the idea of "reverse seeing": that even if she cannot see forward into the spirit world, her friend can see "backward into this world" and be with her. <br><br>Death Tractates is the companion volume to a philosophical poetic work entitles Bright Existence, which Hillman was in the midst of writing when her friend died.

You look directly through the photographer's eyes as each photo gets closer to that perfect shot. And yet, it's often the photos not chosen that best capture the true spirit of their subjects and the life they lead after the director yells cut. This was never truer than in the classic Hollywood era, where behind-the-scenes photos were carefully vetted for marketing purposes and unapproved shots were never expected to be seen again. <em>Hollywood Frame by Frame</em> presents hundreds of never-before-published photos from the sets of some of the greatest films of the twentieth century.

He was still coming.<br><br>Ignoring the tug of pain in her left side, she reached into the trunk of her car for a cardboard box filled with food and supplies she'd grabbed out of her apartment. She thought of the other places she could have exiled herself. New Zealand, for example. The south of France. Costa Rica. It didn't have to be Vermont. Black Falls. Her picturesque hometown in the heart of the Green Mountains.<br><br>It was summer in New Zealand, she thought as she lifted the box on her uninjured hip and noted that it was barely four o'clock and yet almost dark. The long, dark winter nights were upon northern New England. She'd left Washington early in order to arrive in Vermont while it was still daylight.<br><br>Using her elbow, she shut the trunk. Three brown-spotted bananas on top of the overflowing box hadn't fared well on the long trip north, but she hadn't wanted to leave them to rot in her microscopic Georgetown apartment. She didn't know when she'd be back at her job with the Secret Service. Technically, she was just taking some time off. But everyone knew she'd been all but ordered to clear out of town for a bit.<br><br>Jo knew it, too.<br><br>Elijah seemed to be carrying a vase of flowers, but that didn't make sense.<br><br>Flowers? Elijah?<br><br>Even from fifty yards away, he looked as sexy, rugged and forbidden as ever. She hadn't realized he was home from the army. Not that her family in Black Falls would have told her, especially this week&#x2014;because then she really might have chucked it all and bought a one-way ticket to New Zealand.<br><br>Elijah had built a house on the wooded hillside adjoining the thirty acres and its dozen, one-room, falling-down cabins he and his brothers and sister had every reason to expect to inherit one day. Instead, Drew Cameron had left the property to Jo. The shock of his death from hypothermia in an April snowstorm had only been compounded by that one detail in his last will and testament.<br><br>None of the Cameron siblings was more taken aback than Jo was herself by their father's inexplicable act of generosity.<br><br>And yet...<br><br>She pushed the uncomfortable memory of her last encounter with Drew Cameron out of her mind. She didn't want to go there. Not now, not especially with Elijah ambling her way.<br><br>She watched the hawk glide back toward her and disappear into the woods and hills above the cabins.<br><br>Cameron land.<br><br>There was no wind, but the air was brisk and chilly&#x2014;she'd gotten used to Washington's warmer climate. She'd had to pull on her black fleece jacket when she'd crossed the Vermont border. She hadn't expected to be back in Black Falls until Thanksgiving, and then only for a short visit with her family.<br><br>But here she was, and who knew for how long?<br><br>The brightly colored leaves of October had fallen, just the rusts and maroons of dying oak leaves clinging to branches among the hemlocks, pines and spruces along the dot of a glacial lake. Jo noticed a battered dark green wooden canoe in the grayish frost-killed grass down by the lake. It was on her property, but it wasn't her canoe. No doubt it belonged to a Cameron&#x2014;probably the one walking down the road with the flowers.<br><br>She carried her box across the weeds and dead pine needles that passed for a yard. Elijah kept coming. She saw no sign of a limp&#x2014;her sister, Beth, had e-mailed her in April after news hit town that Elijah, a Special Forces soldier, had been wounded, badly, in Afghanistan.<br><br>It was the day after Devin Shay, a Black Falls High School senior, had found Drew Cameron dead on the mountain named for his ancestors.<br><br>Jo stopped at the front door&#x2014;the only door&#x2014;to the largest of the dilapidated cabins. It was set up on blocks and had moss growing on its roof, which couldn't be good, and its board-and-batten exterior needed a fresh coat of dark brown paint.<br><br>But it was the closest to the lake and the best of the lot. Most of the cabins probably should have been condemned years ago. A.J., the eldest Cameron, supposedly had drawn up plans for expanding Black Falls Lodge down to the lake, never expecting the land wouldn't one day be his.<br><br>Elijah left the dirt road and walked toward her as if he didn't have a care in the world. He wore a canvas jacket, close-fitting jeans and a navy blue Red Sox cap, and Jo noted the dark stubble of beard on his square Cameron jaw. If possible, he was even more appealing than he had been at nineteen, when he had whisked her off for three nights and four days in the very cabins she had just inherited.<br><br>She had never loved anyone the way she had Elijah Cameron.<br><br>But that was a long time ago.<br><br>He came up to the doorstep with his vase of flowers. They were all lilies&#x2014;Asiatic lilies in varying shades of cream, apricot and copper.<br><br>Jo settled the box onto her right hip. She could have stayed with her sister or brother or in her old room growing up, but she'd opted for space, quiet and solitude. She'd always loved the lake. While she was doing damage control on her career, she figured she could also consider her options for what to do with her lakefront property.<br><br>Elijah barely contained a smile. "Rough week, Agent Harper?"<br><br>It wasn't looking to get better anytime soon. "Hello, Elijah."<br><br>"Jo."<br><br>"I didn't see you&#x2014;"<br><br>"Not a chance. You're a Secret Service agent who protects the lives of important people. You spotted me before you took the key out of your ignition."<br><br>She sighed. "You're not going to make this easy, are you?"<br><br>His eyes, the same deep blue that had captivated her as a teenager, sparked with humor. "No, ma'am. It's too good."<br><br>"No one else is making this easy. No reason you should." She nodded to the enormous vase of lilies he carried in the crook of one arm. "Taking up flower arranging, Elijah?"<br><br>"Penny dropped them off earlier. She didn't want to leave them out in the open. They're for you."<br><br>Penny Hodges owned the only flower shop in Black Falls and had always had a soft spot for Elijah. She and his mother had been best friends. Drew used to accuse both women of coddling his second-born son and had seen himself as the only one willing to impose discipline on him.<br><br>Ancient history, Jo thought, and now both Elijah's parents were gone.<br><br>"Who're they from?" she asked.<br><br>"What makes you think I know?"<br><br>"You looked at the card."<br><br>"Ah. Well." He sniffed an apricot-colored lily. "So I did. Are you armed?"<br><br>"Elijah&#x2014;"<br><br>"It can be dangerous, having a badass Secret Service agent next door."<br><br>Just her luck that Elijah would be the first person she ran into in Black Falls. Despite the ordeals of the past seven months&#x2014;his father's death, his own near death&#x2014;he looked fit, as muscular and as physical as ever. But Jo didn't fool herself. Elijah Cameron wasn't the same small-town Vermont boy who had stolen her heart and soul as a teenager.<br><br>And she wasn't the same small-town girl.<br><br>"If the flowers are a gag gift from one of my colleagues, you can dump them in the lake. Paddle your canoe out to a deep spot and give them the heave-ho."<br><br>"They're from your new best friend in Washington."<br><br>Charlie Neal, Jo thought. That little bastard had the gall to send her flowers.<br><br>She contained her reaction and said tightly, "Take them inside if you would. My hands aren't exactly free."<br><br>Elijah tugged open the rickety screen door. "Did you pick this cabin for old times' sake?"<br><br>It was the cabin where they'd made love night and day after her high-school graduation. He had graduated the year before and spent the year working at Black Falls Lodge&#x2014;long before A.J. took it over&#x2014;and avoiding arrest by Jo's father, the local police chief.<br><br>"This one has the best heat," Jo said, neutral.<br><br>"It also has bats. I see them flying in and out at dusk."<br><br>"It's too cold now for bats."<br><br>"They're snug in their beds up in your rafters," he said, entering the cabin.<br><br>Jo stepped inside and set her box on the rough wood floor next to her duffel bag, which she'd already hauled from her car. She wasn't that sure what all she'd packed. Frustrated, aggravated, anxious to get out of Washington as fast as she could, she'd tossed together clothes, reading material and leftovers with little thought to what she'd need.<br><br>Elijah put the flowers on the small drop-leaf table near the window overlooking the lake. Three of her colleagues who'd stayed in the cabins in October had referred to the decor as early junkyard, but they'd enjoyed the setting&#x2014;the woods, the lake, the hills. They'd hiked, fished, gone canoeing, read books in the quiet.<br><br>That was before Jo's bad week. She doubted any of her fellow Secret Service agents would head to Vermont anytime soon, even if she did fix up the cabins.<br><br>She avoided looking at the iron four-poster bed in the alcove&#x2014;it was the same bed she and Elijah had found so useful fifteen years ago.<br><br>"How long are you planning to stay?" he asked.<br><br>"Until the dust settles in Washington."<br><br>Jo bent down and grabbed the bananas from the top of her box. How long <i>would </i>she be here? As she stood up straight again, she tried not to wince in front of Elijah, a matter of personal pride, but she knew she'd failed.<br><br>"Still hurting?" he asked with no detectable amusement or sarcasm.<br><br>"Not really."<br><br>"Baking soda and water might help."<br><br><i>Now </i>she detected a note of amusement and sarcasm. "Thanks. I'm fine."<br><br>She had heard every conceivable homemade remedy in the past seventy-two hours, ever since she'd fallen victim to a prank orchestrated by the sixteen-year-old son of the vice president of the United States. Charles Preston Neal was a notorious handful. He had invited his cousins and friends over to the madhouse that was the vice president's residence for an elaborate simulated firefight with realistic-looking fake weapons. Jo was assigned to Marissa Neal, the eldest of Charlie's four older sisters, who lived nearby and was there for a visit.<br><br>Five minutes into their firefight, Charlie had pointed at his cousin Conor, who was about to shoot, and yelled, "I think it's a real gun!"<br><br>Jo had reacted instantly, jumping into action to save Charlie and his friends from possible injury or death. But the "weapon" turned out to be another of the authentic-looking toy pistols and rifles in the boys' extensive arsenal. She'd intercepted a barrage of airsoft pellets zipping toward Charlie and took the dozens of tiny, fake rounds meant for him.<br><br>Trying to live down the spray of pinprick welts on her left arm, side and hip would have been bad enough, but Charlie had collapsed in hysterical laughter, and that was it. Jo pulled him up by the ear and gave him an uncensored piece of her mind.<br><br><i>That </i>was what one of his cousins or friends&#x2014;no one knew which one&#x2014;had secretly captured on video and put on the Internet.<br><br>Hence, today's drive up to Vermont.<br><br>Vice President Neal had mandated the boys all take a police-sanctioned safety course if they were to have any more simulated battles in the backyard, and he'd personally sat them down at the kitchen table and had them write notes of apology to Jo. There was no telling how many of them were in on the prank, but Charlie clearly was the ringleader.<br><br>But the damage was done. The video was out there forever, with Secret Service Special Agent Jo Harper grabbing the vice president's son by the ear and giving him a piece of her mind.<br><br>Not one of the finer moments in her career.<br><br>Marissa Neal was sympathetic, having fallen victim to her brother's pranks herself. Jo's quick action a few weeks earlier had saved Marissa from severe burns and possibly death when a gas stove had exploded in a cabin she and friends had rented in the Shenandoah Mountains. A simple accident. It wasn't publicized, much less splashed over the Internet.<br><br>"Dyeing your hair these days, Jo?"<br><br>She frowned at Elijah. "What?"<br><br>"I like the copper," he said, then nodded to the flowers. "That must explain Charlie's choice of colors for your lilies. They go with your hair."<br><br>"He has an IQ of a hundred and eighty. He knows how to manipulate people."<br><br>"Maybe he has a crush on you."<br><br>"I doubt that."<br><br>The youngest of five and the only son of a busy, popular vice president, Charlie was also desperate to be noticed, desperate to matter. As a Secret Service agent, and one not directly assigned to him, Jo couldn't let that be her concern&#x2014; but she couldn't help but notice, either.<br><br>He was also fair-haired, good-looking, exceptionally bright and surprisingly unworldly given his wealthy, high-profile family background.<br><br>Elijah pushed open the screen door and glanced back at her. "You really can't tell a toy gun from a real one?"<br><br>"Go ahead, Elijah, have your fun. Yes, I can tell. That's not why I got hit." She set the bananas on the two-foot cracked Formica counter in the bare-bones kitchen area. They'd be mush by morning. "It doesn't matter. Charlie and the rest of those kids are all safe."<br><br>"You did your job," Elijah said.<br><br>"That's the way I look at it."<br><br>His eyes stayed on her for a fraction longer than she found comfortable. "Didn't know I was back, did you?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>She returned to the box and saw that she'd made a mistake in packing the three cartons of yogurt she'd had in her fridge.<br><br>They were squished now, and ten hours in her trunk couldn't have been good for their contents.<br><br>Thinking about yogurt gone bad wasn't enough to distract her from the man standing in the doorway.<br><br>"I heard you were wounded," she said, raising her gaze to him. "You're okay now?"<br><br>"Never better."<br><br>His response was classic Elijah. Jo had never met anyone more resilient. Most of his years as a Special Forces soldier were clouded in mystery and the subject of much speculation in Black Falls. Even with her high-level security clearances, Jo doubted she could find out the specifics of the April fire-fight. She'd heard that a bullet had nicked his femoral artery, a highly dangerous injury. He could have easily bled to death.<br><br>According to her sister, he was evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in southern Germany, and only when he was out of danger had his family informed him of his father's death. Beth had heard the story straight from Rose Cameron, Elijah's younger sister, who had flown to Germany to be with her brother.<br><br>"But he already knew," Beth had said. "No one had to tell him."<br><br>Jo suspected that one look at Rose's face probably had been enough for Elijah to figure out the bad news for himself.<br><br></p><h2>Olive Farm</h2><p>After all, they are newlyweds of limited means, and Carol is still adjusting to her role as stepmother to Michel&#x2019;s two daughters. But the splendor of the region becomes a force they are unable to resist. Michel presents their life savings to the real estate broker as a down payment for the farm, embarking the family on an adventure that will bring them in close contact with the charming countryside, querulous personalities, petty bureaucracies, and extraordinary wildlife (including a ravenous wild boar) of Provence. In the spirit of Peter Mayle&#x2019;s A Year in Provence and Frances Mayes&#x2019;s Under the Tuscan Sun, The Olive Farm is a splendid tour of southern France, from the glamour of Cannes to the Iles de Lï¿½rins and a Cistercian monastery on the tiny isle of St. Honorat, to Carol Drinkwater&#x2019;s own small piece of land, which she transforms from an overgrown plot of weeds and ivy to a thriving, productive farm, transforming in the process her own dream of a peaceful and meaningful life into reality.</p><p><b>Carol Drinkwater</b> is a multi-award-winning actress who is best known for her portrayal of Helen Herriot in the BBC television series <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i>, and is the author of more than 20 books, both fiction and nonfiction. Her quartet of memoirs set on her olive farm in the south of France have sold more than a million copies worldwide, and her solo journey through the Mediterranean in search of the olive tree's mythical secrets inspired a five-part documentary film series. Carol lives in the south of France, where she is writing her next novel.Following in the footsteps of bestselling authors Peter Mayle (A Year in Provence) and Frances Mayes (Under the Tuscan Sun), Drinkwater has written a memoir of her flight to the good life in southern France. "All my life-long, I dreamed of acquiring a shabby-chic house and renovating it," writes the author, a British actress who starred in the BBC adaptation of James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small. When she and her husband, Michel, spot a hillside villa with an olive vineyard in a village near Cannes, they defy common sense and become landowners. Never mind that it is moldering and insect-infested, the roof leaks and there doesn't seem to be any running water. Drinkwater's account of paradise regained involves bushwhacking through the intricacies of French property law and battling the elements of nature (wind, rain and fire), to say nothing of the eccentric local population. Alas, the book reads, by turns, like a catalogue of the author's real-estate woes ("We have a leaking roof!") and a ponderous love poem ("We are two embarking on this path together. Newly in love. Thrilled by one another... Investing in love, in one another.").

As an interdisciplinary field, moreover, semiotics has produced a vast literature from many different points of view. As the discourse has expanded, clear definitions and goals become more elusive. Semioticians still lack a unified theory of the purposes of semiotics as a discipline as well as a comprehensive rationale for the4 linking of semiosis at the levels of culture, society, and nature. As Deely suggests in his preface, the image of the modern semiotic universe is the same as that of astronomy in 1611 as suggested by John Donne: "Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone; / All just supply, and all Relation." <p>This short, cogent, philosophically oriented book outlines and analyzes the basic concepts of semiotics in a coherent, overall framework.</p></p><p>John Deely is Professor of philosophy at the Center for Thomistic Studies of the University of St. Thomas (Houston), and author of numerous works on philosophy and semiotics, most recently The Impact on Philosophy of Semiotics (St. Augustine&#39;s Press), The Four Ages of Understanding (Toronto), and What Distinguishes Human Understanding (St. Augustine&#39;s Press).[T]he only successful modern English introduction to semiotics ... a clear, creative, and provocative synthesis of major trends, past and present. -- <i>Thomas A.

But some mornings disease and despair seemed to permeate the congregation like floodwaters in sandbags, and the only people who stood during the moment when we shared our joys and concerns were those souls who were intimately acquainted with nursing homes, ICUs, and the nearby hospice. Concerns invariably outnumbered joys, but there were some Sundays that were absolute routs, and it would seem that the only people rising up in their pews to speak needed Prozac considerably more than they needed prayer. Or yes, than they needed me. <br><br>On those sorts of Sundays, whenever someone would stand and ask for prayers for something relatively minor&#x2014;a promotion, traveling mercies, a broken leg that surely would mend&#x2014;I would find myself thinking as I stood in the pulpit, Get a spine, you bloody ingrate! Buck up! That lady behind you is about to lose her husband to pancreatic cancer, and you&#x2019;re whining about your difficult boss? Oh, please! I never said that sort of thing aloud, but I think that&#x2019;s only because I&#x2019;m from a particularly mannered suburb of New York City, and so my family has to be drunk to be cutting. I did love my congregation, but I also knew that I had an inordinate number of whiners. <br><br>The Sunday service that preceded Alice Hayward&#x2019;s baptism and death was especially rich in genuine human tragedy, it was just jam-packed with the real McCoy&#x2014;one long ballad of ceaseless lamentation and pain. Moreover, as a result of that morning&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s message and a choir member&#x2019;s solo, it was also unusually moving. The whiners knew that they couldn&#x2019;t compete with the legitimate, no- holds- barred sort of torment that was besieging much of the congregation, and so they kept their fannies in their seats and their prayer requests to themselves. <br><br>That day we heard from a thirty- four- year- old lawyer who had alï¿½ready endured twelve weeks of radiation for a brain tumor and was now in his second week of chemotherapy. He was on steroids, and so on top of everything else he had to endure the indignity of a sudden physical resemblance to a human blowfish. He gave the children&#x2019;s message that Sunday, and he told the children&#x2014;toddlers and girls and boys as old as ten and eleven&#x2014;who surrounded him at the front of the church how he&#x2019;d learned in the last three months that while some anï¿½gels might really have halos and wings, he&#x2019;d met a great many more who looked an awful lot like regular people. When he started to deï¿½scribe the angels he&#x2019;d seen&#x2014;describing, in essence, the members of the church Women&#x2019;s Circle who drove him back and forth to the hospital, or the folks who filled his family&#x2019;s refrigerator with fresh vegï¿½etables and homemade carrot juice, or the people who barely knew him yet sent cards and letters&#x2014;I saw eyes in the congregation grow dewy. And, of course, I knew how badly some of those &nbsp;half- blind old ladies in the Women&#x2019;s Circle drove, which seemed to me a further inï¿½dication that there may indeed be angels among us. <br><br>Then, after the older children had returned to the pews where their parents were sitting while the younger ones had been escorted to the playroom in the church&#x2019;s addition so they would be spared the secï¿½ond half of the service (including my sermon), a fellow in the choir with a lush, robust tenor sang &#x201c;It is well with my soul,&#x201d; and he sang it without the accompaniment of our organist. Spafford wrote that hymn after his four daughters had drowned when their ship, the <i>Ville de Havre, </i>collided with another vessel and sank. When the tenor&#x2019;s voice rose for the refrain for the last time, his hands before him and his long fingers steepling together before his chest, the congregation spontaneously joined him. There was a pause when they finished, folï¿½lowed by a great forward <i>whoosh </i>from the pews as the members of the church as one exhaled in wonder, &#x201c;Amen....&#x201d; <br><br>And so when it came time for our moment together of caring and sharing (an expression I use without irony, though I admit it sounds vaguely like doggerel and more than a little New Age), the people were primed to pour out their hearts. And they did. I&#x2019;ve looked back at the notes I scribbled from the pulpit that morning&#x2014;the names of the people for whom we were supposed to pray and exactly what ailed them&#x2014;and by any objective measure there really was a lot of horror that day. Cancer and cystic fibrosis and a disease that would cost a newborn her right eye. A car accident. A house fire. A truck bomb in a land far away. We prayed for people dying at home, in area hospitals, at the hospice in the next town. We prayed for healing, we prayed for death (though we used that great euphemism <i>relief </i>), we prayed for peace. We prayed for peace in souls that were turbulent and for peace in a corner of the world that was in the midst of a civil war. <br><br>By the time I began my sermon, I could have been as inspiring as a tax attorney and people would neither have noticed nor cared. I could have been awful&#x2014;though the truth is, I wasn&#x2019;t; my words at the very least transcended hollow that morning&#x2014;and still they would have been moved. They were craving inspiration the way I crave sunï¿½light in January.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Nevertheless, that Sunday service offered a litany of the ways we can die and the catastrophes that can assail us. Who knew that the worst was yet to come? (In theory, I know the answer to that, but we won&#x2019;t go there. At least not yet.) The particular tragedy that would give our little village its grisly notoriety was still almost a dozen hours away and wouldn&#x2019;t begin to unfold until the warm front had arrived in the late afternoon and early evening and we had all begun to swelter over our dinners. There was so much still in between: the potluck, the baptism, the word. <br><br>Not <i>the </i>word, though I do see it as both the beginning and the end: In the beginning was the Word.... <br><br><i>There. </i>That was the word in this case. <i>There. <br></i><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Alice Hayward said to me after I had baptized her in the pond that Sunday, a smile on her face that I can only call grim. There. <br><br>The baptism immediately followed the Sunday service, a good old- fashioned, &nbsp;once- a- year Baptist dunking in the Brookners&#x2019; pond. Behind me I heard the congregation clapping for Alice, including the members of the Women&#x2019;s Circle, at least one of whom, like me, was aware of what sometimes went on in the house the Haywards had built together on the ridge. <br><br>None of them, I know now, had heard what she&#x2019;d said. But even if they had, I doubt they would have heard in that one word exactly what I did, because that single syllable hadn&#x2019;t been meant for them. It had been meant only for me.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; I said to Alice in response. Nodding. Agreeing. Af ï¿½firming her faith. A single syllable uttered from my own lips. It was the word that gave Alice Hayward all the reassurance she needed to go forward into the death that her husband may have been envisioning for her&#x2014;perhaps even for the two of them&#x2014;for years.<br><i>From Chapter Seven<br></i><br><b>Catherine Benincasa<br></b><br>My husband is a great guy. It doesn&#x2019;t take a dirtball like George Hayward or Stephen Drew for me to see that. I think those two have a lot more in common than the reverend ever would be willing to admit. <br><br>But that&#x2019;s the thing about men like that. Total denial. Everyone talks about how a battered woman has a complete unwillingness to admit to herself what&#x2019;s really going on in her life, and I can tell you that the river Denial is indeed pretty freaking wide in the minds of a lot of those victims. The worst, for me, are those cases where some boyfriend or stepfather is abusing the woman&#x2019;s daughters, and when we finally charge the bastard&#x2014;when the daughter finally comes for-ward&#x2014;the woman defends the guy! Takes his side! Insists her own kid must be making this up or exaggerating. Trust me: No &nbsp;twelve- year- old girl exaggerates when Mom&#x2019;s boyfriend makes her do things to him with her mouth. <br><br>And, clearly, Alice Hayward was no stranger to denial herself. When I returned to my office that Monday after viewing the mess up in Haverill, I learned that Alice had gotten a temporary relief- from- abuse &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>order that winter. Had managed to kick her husband&#x2019;s ornery ass out of the house and&#x2014;somehow&#x2014;gotten him to go live for a couple of months at their place on Lake Bomoseen. And then, like so many battered women, had taken him back. Hadn&#x2019;t even shown up for the hearing a week after the papers were served. <br><br>But the men&#x2019;s rationalizations are even worse. They&#x2019;ll curl your hair. <br><br>Now, Stephen Drew wasn&#x2019;t using some poor woman&#x2019;s face as a floor sander, and he wasn&#x2019;t inflicting himself on some defenseless middle- school girl. (Note I am not being catty and adding &#x201c;as far as we know.&#x201d; Because, in my opinion, we do know: He wasn&#x2019;t.) But he certainly abused his place and his power, and he sure as hell took advantage of women in his congregation. For a minister, the guy had ice in his veins.

Things already aren't going so well, when one of the strongest in the crew dies suddenly. Afraid for her life, fellow digger and forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson probes the rocky topsoil for a reason behind the evil aura of death that seems to hover over them. Is the excavation cursed by the ancient dead...or is there a more modern explanation behind the group's strangely rising mortality rate...?</p><p>It's hard to say which is my favorite of McCrumb's Elizabeth MacPherson murder mysteries. She's a funny lady and every one of her very well-plotted MacPherson novels is full of all manner of zany characters. In some ways, though, this early one -- 1988 -- is one I'd recommend first to a reader new to Sharyn McCrumb. It's set on a small Scottish island, full of ominous atmosphere, naturally, where Elizabeth, a forensic anthropologist, and a crew of archaeologists are looking into prehistoric burial rites. And then, of course, a crew member dies. I tried to play detective while I read, but Paying the Piper totally faked me out -- McCrumb used one of the most ingenious murder methods I've ever come across in a lifetime of reading mysteries.<br><br>--Margaret Sanborn, Senior Publicity Copywriter</p><h2>Triangular Road: A Memoir</h2><p>In <i>Triangular Road</i>, famed novelist Paule Marshall tells the story of her years as a fledgling young writer in the 1960s. A memoir of self-discovery, it also offers an affectionate tribute to the inimitable Langston Hughes, who entered Marshall's life during a crucial phase and introduced her to the world of European letters during a whirlwind tour of the continent funded by the State Department. In the course of her journeys to Europe, Barbados, and eventually Africa, Marshall comes to comprehend the historical enormity of the African diaspora, an understanding that fortifies her sense of purpose as a writer.<p>In this unflinchingly honest memoir, Paule Marshall offers an indelible portrait of a young black woman coming of age as a novelist in a literary world dominated by white men.</p></p><p><b>Paule Marshall</b> is the author of five novels: <i>Brown Girl, Brownstones</i>; <i>The Chosen Place, The Timeless People</i>; <i>Praisesong for the Widow</i>; <i>Daughters</i>; and <i>The Fisher King</i>. A MacArthur Fellow and winner of the Dos Passos Prize for Literature, Professor Marshall has taught at various universities over the course of her lifetime; she now holds the Helen Gould Sheppard Chair of Literature and Culture at New York University. She lives in New York and Richmond, Virginia.Starred Review. This elegant, passionate, elliptical memoir of self-exploration and revelation transports the reader well beyond its origins as a series of Harvard lectures. The title is an allusion to novelist and MacArthur fellow Marshall's (<i>The Fisher King</i>) geographic, intellectual and emotional triangulation among the peoples and locales that shaped her&#x2014;Barbados and Grenada; the Bajan community of Brooklyn; and Africa. Marshall begins with a 1965 State Department&#x2013;sponsored tour of Europe in the company of her idol, Langston Hughes, when she was a young author and civil rights activist. The book continues as a meditation on Bodies of Water (the theme of the original lecture series) as diverse as the James River, the principal port of entry for African slaves in the 18th century, and the Caribbean. Among other personal stories that give her book artistic flair are Marshall's early encounter with the redoubtable editor Hiram Haydn; her disturbing experience with another editor, who was giddy over her upcoming tour of a Virginia plantation (Our association ended shortly thereafter, Marshall writes drily); and her father's odd devotion to Father Divine. When the USIS again taps Marshall, this time for a mission to Nigeria, the reception she and other U.S. representatives elicit from some of their hosts&#x2014;welcome combined with shame over their ancestors' complicity in the slave trade&#x2014;is revelatory. 6 illus. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But gorgeously defiant Arabella sparks frustration&#x2013; and something deeply erotic&#x2013;in Marcus. After matching both wits and swords with her, Marcus concludes that this beautiful and formidable foe must be his.<br><br> Having sworn off marriage and men, Arabella wishes to be left alone to run her finishing school for young ladies. To that end, she boldly accepts Marcus&#x2019;s intimate challenge: If he can woo and win her within two weeks, she&#x2019;ll take her place in his bed as his wife. However, if she can resist his considerable charms, the Loring sisters will be granted their independence. Thus an extraordinary game of seduction begins. . . .</p><p>Nicole Jordan is the nationally bestselling author of fifteen historical romances. She recently moved with her real-life hero to the Rocky Mountains of Utah, where she is at work on the next book of her scorching Notorious series&#x2013;tales of dangerous rakes and bold adventurers during the Regency era.<i>I vow the new earl will drive me to distraction, thinking&nbsp;to marry us off like so much breeding stock.&nbsp;</i>&#x2013;Letter from Miss Arabella Loring to Fanny Irwin&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>London, May 1817&nbsp;<br><br></i></b><i>Matrimony. </i>The very word was menacing. Yet the&nbsp;new Earl of Danvers could ignore the topic no longer,&nbsp;much to his regret.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;A pity the late earl already met his end,&#x201d; Lord Danvers&nbsp;professed, punctuating his declaration with the&nbsp;slash of a steel rapier. &#x201c;Otherwise I would have his&nbsp;heart on a spit for the trick he served me, leaving me to&nbsp;play procurer for three wards I never wanted.&#x201d;&nbsp;His complaint, voiced amid the sounds of swordplay,&nbsp;was met with both sympathetic laughter and&nbsp;skepticism from his friends.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Procurer, Marcus? Isn&#x2019;t that something of an exaggeration?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It perfectly describes my responsibility.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Matchmaker is a more tasteful characterization.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Matchmaker. </i>What a lowering thought.&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus Pierce, formerly addressed as Baron Pierce&nbsp;and now the eighth Lord Danvers, winced with reluctant&nbsp;humor. Although he normally relished a challenge,&nbsp;he would gladly have forgone being saddled with three&nbsp;penniless beauties&#x2013;and worse, the burden of finding&nbsp;them respectable husbands.&nbsp;<br><br>Yet he&#x2019;d inherited the Loring sisters along with his&nbsp;new title, so he was resigned to discharging his duty&nbsp;sooner or later.&nbsp;<br><br>Preferably later.&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus had enjoyed thirty-two pleasurable years of&nbsp;bachelorhood, the last ten as one of England&#x2019;s most eligible&nbsp;and elusive marital catches. Since matrimony&nbsp;ranked high on his list of least-favorite subjects, he had&nbsp;put off facing his obligation to his unwanted wards for&nbsp;weeks now.&nbsp;<br><br>This fine spring morning, however, he&#x2019;d finally&nbsp;forced himself to broach the issue while he was engaged&nbsp;in fencing practice at his Mayfair mansion with&nbsp;his two closest friends and fellow escapees of the Marriage&nbsp;Mart.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;But you do see my dilemma?&#x201d; Marcus asked, executing&nbsp;a swift parry against his equally skilled opponent,&nbsp;Andrew Moncrief, Duke of Arden.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, yes,&#x201d; Drew answered above the clang of blades.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You hope to marry off your three wards, but you expect&nbsp;to find few takers, given the scandal in their family.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Precisely.&#x201d; Marcus flashed an engaging grin. &#x201c;I&nbsp;don&#x2019;t suppose you would volunteer to offer for one of&nbsp;them?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The duke shot him an eloquent glance as he leapt&nbsp;back to evade a deft thrust. &#x201c;As much as I yearn to help you, old sport, I cherish my liberty too much to&nbsp;make such a devastating sacrifice, even for you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Stubble it, Marcus.&#x201d; The amused drawl came from&nbsp;the sidelines of the salon that Marcus used as a fencing&nbsp;hall. Heath Griffin, Marquess of Claybourne, lounged&nbsp;on a settee as he awaited his turn at practice, drawing&nbsp;idle patterns in the air with his foil. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re touched in&nbsp;the head if you think to persuade us to offer for your&nbsp;wards.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;They are reputed to be great beauties,&#x201d; Marcus&nbsp;coaxed.&nbsp;<br><br>Heath laughed outright. &#x201c;And spinsters, every one&nbsp;of them. How old is the eldest Miss Loring? Four and&nbsp;twenty?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Not quite that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;But she is said to be a spitfire.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m told,&#x201d; Marcus reluctantly acknowledged.&nbsp;His solicitors had described Arabella Loring as&nbsp;charming but fiercely stubborn-minded in her desire&nbsp;for emancipation from his guardianship.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t met her yet?&#x201d; Heath asked.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ve managed to avoid her thus far. The Misses&nbsp;Loring were away from home when I called to pay my&nbsp;condolences on the death of their step-uncle three&nbsp;months ago. And since then, I&#x2019;ve let my solicitors handle&nbsp;all succeeding correspondence. But I will have to&nbsp;deal with them eventually.&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;I will likely&nbsp;travel to Chiswick next week.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The Danvers estate was in the countryside near the&nbsp;small village of Chiswick, some half dozen miles west&nbsp;of London&#x2019;s fashionable Mayfair district, where many&nbsp;of the wealthy aristocracy resided. The distance was&nbsp;an easy drive in a fast curricle, yet Marcus was under&nbsp;no illusions that his task could be dispatched quickly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;From everything I hear,&#x201d; Drew said as he steadily&nbsp;advanced, &#x201c;your wards will indeed prove a handful. It&nbsp;won&#x2019;t be easy to marry them off, particularly the eldest.&#x201d;&nbsp;Nodding, Marcus gave a wry grimace. &#x201c;Certainly&nbsp;not when they profess to be so adamantly opposed to&nbsp;marriage. I&#x2019;ve offered to provide them significant&nbsp;dowries to induce respectable suitors to wed them, but&nbsp;they rejected my proposition out of hand.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Harbor bluestocking notions of independence, do&nbsp;they?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;So it would seem. A pity I can&#x2019;t convince either of&nbsp;you to come to my rescue.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>It would have been a neat solution to his dilemma,&nbsp;Marcus reflected as he fought off Drew&#x2019;s determined offensive.&nbsp;In addition to inheriting the title of earl to add&nbsp;to his long-held barony, he&#x2019;d been encumbered with the&nbsp;entailed and impoverished Danvers estate, as well as responsibility&nbsp;for its genteel dependents, three indigent&nbsp;sisters. All three were blessed with impeccable lineage,&nbsp;superb breeding, and enviable beauty, but all were unmarried&nbsp;and getting somewhat long in the tooth.&nbsp;<br><br>Their single state was due less to their lack of fortune&nbsp;than to the horrendous scandal in their family. Four&nbsp;years ago, their mother had run off to the Continent&nbsp;with her French lover. Then barely a fortnight later,&nbsp;their father had been killed in a duel over his latest&nbsp;mistress&#x2013;which had put an abrupt end to any last gasp<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>chances the daughters had of marrying well.&nbsp;<br><br>Resolving to give his unwanted wards into more&nbsp;willing hands, Marcus had thought to marry them off&nbsp;by providing them with immense dowries. But that&nbsp;was before he&#x2019;d discovered how fiercely independent&nbsp;the three beauties were. The eldest sister&#x2019;s letters had&nbsp;become downright impassioned in her appeals for&nbsp;self-rule.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;They are legally my wards until they turn twentyfive,&#x201d;&nbsp;Marcus explained, &#x201c;but the eldest, Arabella, is already&nbsp;fretting over the constraints. In the past month,&nbsp;she has written me four letters proclaiming that she and&nbsp;her sisters have no need of a guardian at their advanced&nbsp;ages. Regrettably for us all, I am bound by the terms of&nbsp;the will.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Pausing to circle his opponent, Marcus ran a hand&nbsp;roughly through his raven hair. &#x201c;Truthfully,&#x201d; he muttered,&nbsp;&#x201c;it would have suited me better had I never&nbsp;heard of the Loring sisters. I never wished for the additional&nbsp;title. I was perfectly content as a baron.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>His friends offered him sympathetic but amused&nbsp;looks, which prompted Marcus to add pointedly, &#x201c;I&nbsp;expect your help in solving my dilemma, you spineless&nbsp;reprobates. Surely you can think of some appropriate&nbsp;candidates I can throw their way.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You could always offer for one of them yourself,&#x201d;&nbsp;Heath suggested, a wicked gleam in his eye.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;God forbid.&#x201d; Marcus paused to shudder and was&nbsp;nearly skewered when Drew lunged with his foil.&nbsp;Through much of their boyhood and all of their&nbsp;adulthood, the three of them&#x2013;Marcus, Drew, and<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>Heath&#x2013;had been inseparable, having attended Eton&nbsp;and Oxford together and then come into their vast fortunes&nbsp;and illustrious titles the same year. And after&nbsp;being chased relentlessly by marriage-minded debutantes&nbsp;and barely eluding the traps of countless matchmaking&nbsp;mamas, all three shared grave reservations&nbsp;about the institution of matrimony. Most particularly&nbsp;the sort of cold, convenient union typical of the aristocracy.&nbsp;Marcus had never encountered even one woman he&nbsp;might want to take for his wife. The thought of being&nbsp;shackled for life to a female he scarcely liked, much&nbsp;less loved, sent chills down his spine. Yet he owed it to&nbsp;his titles, both the new and the old, to carry on his&nbsp;bloodlines, so eventually he would have to marry.&nbsp;<br><br>The demise of his bachelorhood, however, would be&nbsp;a long time in coming, Marcus vowed.&nbsp;<br><br>Realizing his concentration had been shattered by&nbsp;all this unpalatable talk of matrimony, he stepped&nbsp;back and offered Drew a sardonic salute. &#x201c;I had best&nbsp;withdraw before you slice me to ribbons, your grace.&nbsp;Heath, pray take your turn at practice.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>When the marquess replaced him on the floor, Marcus&nbsp;crossed the salon to a side table, where he set down&nbsp;his rapier and retrieved a towel to wipe his damp brow.&nbsp;The clash of steel had just resumed when he heard a&nbsp;commotion out in the corridor, coming from the vicinity&nbsp;of his entrance hall. He could only make out every&nbsp;third word or so, but it was clear he had a female&nbsp;caller . . . and that his butler was denying his presence.&nbsp;<br><br>His curiosity piqued, Marcus moved closer to the<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>salon door, the better to hear.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I repeat, Lord Danvers is not at home, miss.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at home or not receiving callers?&#x201d; the female&nbsp;voice asked pleasantly. &#x201c;I have come a long distance in&nbsp;order to speak with him. I am willing to search the&nbsp;premises if I must.&#x201d; Her voice was low and melodious&nbsp;but definitely determined. &#x201c;Where may I find him?&#x201d;&nbsp;There followed sounds of a scuffle. Apparently&nbsp;Hobbs was attempting to prevent her from entering the&nbsp;house but losing the battle. A moment later his august&nbsp;servant actually yelped. &#x201c;Madam, you cannot go&nbsp;abovestairs!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Picturing the butler blocking the foot of the mansion&#x2019;s&nbsp;sweeping staircase, Marcus found himself stifling&nbsp;a grin.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; she queried. &#x201c;Will I find his lordship&nbsp;abed or in a state of undress?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Hobbs let out a shocked exclamation before muttering,&nbsp;&#x201c;Very well, if you insist. I will inquire if his lordship&nbsp;is receiving.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Pray, don&#x2019;t trouble yourself. Just tell me where he&nbsp;is, and I will announce myself.&#x201d; The dulcet voice&nbsp;paused. &#x201c;Never mind. I hear swordplay, so I expect I&nbsp;need only follow the sounds.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus braced himself as light footsteps approached&nbsp;along the corridor.&nbsp;<br><br>The woman who appeared in the doorway a moment&nbsp;later was striking in her loveliness. Although her&nbsp;tall, elegant figure was gowned modestly in a blue&nbsp;crepe carriage dress, she possessed an unmistakable confidence, a graceful presence, that compelled attention.&nbsp;<br><br>A beauty of substance, Marcus realized at once,&nbsp;captivated by the sight.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite her unusual height and slenderness, she was&nbsp;curvaceous enough to entice even a man of his jaded&nbsp;experience. Her pale red-gold hair was swept up beneath&nbsp;a bonnet, with curling tendrils spilling around&nbsp;her finely-boned face. He was mainly aware, however,&nbsp;of the pair of keen gray eyes surveying the room, the&nbsp;most intriguing he had ever seen. They were the hue of&nbsp;silver smoke and held an intelligence and warmth that&nbsp;instantly stirred his senses.&nbsp;<br><br>Her jaw was set with determination, yet when she&nbsp;spied him, she suddenly faltered. A slight blush rose&nbsp;to her cheeks, as if she realized the impropriety of&nbsp;barging in on three noblemen engaged in a fencing&nbsp;match, all dressed in shirtsleeves and breeches and&nbsp;boots, with no cravats or waistcoats or coats.&nbsp;<br><br>Her eyes traveled from Marcus&#x2019;s bare throat to his&nbsp;linen shirt that hung partway open, exposing his&nbsp;chest. Then abruptly, she jerked her gaze back up to&nbsp;his face, as if knowing she&#x2019;d been caught in a forbidden&nbsp;scrutiny. When he locked glances with her, the&nbsp;color mounted in her cheeks.&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus found himself enchanted.&nbsp;<br><br>An instant later she appeared to gather her wits and&nbsp;forged ahead with her mission. &#x201c;Which of you gentlemen&nbsp;is Lord Danvers?&#x201d; she asked sweetly.&nbsp;<br><br>He took a polite step toward her. &#x201c;At your service,&nbsp;Miss . . . ?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>A vexed Hobbs answered behind her, &#x201c;Miss Arabella<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>Loring to see you, my lord.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I take it you are my eldest ward,&#x201d; Marcus observed,&nbsp;concealing his amusement.&nbsp;<br><br>Her lovely mouth tightened the slightest measure,&nbsp;but then she tendered him a charming smile. &#x201c;Regrettably,&nbsp;yes, I am your ward.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Hobbs, take Miss Loring&#x2019;s pelisse and bonnet&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, my lord, but I don&#x2019;t intend to stay long.&nbsp;I only desire a brief interview . . . in private, if I may.&#x201d;&nbsp;By now his two friends had paused in their fencing&nbsp;match and were watching his unexpected visitor with&nbsp;avid curiosity. When she advanced into the room, Marcus&nbsp;saw Drew raise a quizzical eyebrow, expressing surprise&nbsp;at her stunning appearance.&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus was highly surprised himself. Based on his&nbsp;solicitor&#x2019;s comments, he had expected his eldest ward&nbsp;to be something of a shrew, but the reports of her&nbsp;beauty didn&#x2019;t do her justice. She was, to put it simply,&nbsp;magnificent.&nbsp;<br><br>He gave Drew and Heath an apologetic glance.&nbsp;&#x201c;Would you excuse us?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Both noblemen crossed the salon with their rapiers,&nbsp;and Heath flashed Marcus a slow grin as he passed,&nbsp;along with one of his habitually baiting remarks. &#x201c;We&nbsp;will await you in the hall should you need defending.&#x201d;&nbsp;He saw Arabella stiffen at the quip, but then she&nbsp;laughed, a low melodious sound that once more fired&nbsp;his senses. &#x201c;I promise not to do him bodily harm.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>A pity, </i>was Marcus&#x2019;s first thought; he might have&nbsp;appreciated seeing what she could do to his body.&nbsp;When they were alone, however, Marcus fixed his<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>ward with a level gaze. He admired her boldness in&nbsp;coming here but knew he should make some show of&nbsp;disapproval if he intended to keep the upper hand&nbsp;with her. &#x201c;My solicitors warned me about your determination,&nbsp;Miss Loring, but I didn&#x2019;t expect you to flout&nbsp;propriety by visiting me at my home.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>She gave a shrug of her elegant shoulders. &#x201c;You left&nbsp;me little choice, my lord, since you refused to reply to&nbsp;my letters. We have an important matter to discuss.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I agree, we need to settle the issue of your and your&nbsp;sisters&#x2019; futures.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Her hesitation was followed by another proffered&nbsp;smile. &#x201c;I am certain you are a man of reason, Lord&nbsp;Danvers . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus&#x2019;s eyebrow shot up at her obvious attempt to&nbsp;charm him. She was undoubtedly accustomed to&nbsp;twisting men around her fingers, and he felt the effect&nbsp;down to his loins&#x2013;an effect he instinctively resisted.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I am quite reasonable ordinarily.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you...</p><h2>Valley of Darkness</h2><p>This volume portrays the daily life of ordinary Japanese civilians on the home front during World War Two.

In this study, Professor Ackerman sets Palladio in the context of his age - the Humanist era of Michelangelo and Raphael, Titian and Veronese - and examines each of the villas, churches and palaces in turn and tries to penetrate to the heart of the Palladian miracle. Palladio&#39;s theoretical writings are important and illuminating, he suggests, yet they never do justice to the intense intuitive skills of &#34;a magician of light and colour&#34;. Indeed, as the photographs in this book reveal, Palladio was &#34;as sensual, as skilled in visual alchemy as any Venetian painter of his time&#34;, and his countless imitators have usually captured the details, but not the essence of his style.

Tillage has hastened the erosion of irreplaceable topsoil everywhere and a technology based on fossil fuels has increased yields for short-term profits, leaving crops ever more vulnerable to diseases, pests, and droughts. Such, says Jackson, is "the failure of success." As high-technology agriculture becomes more wasteful and expensive, more farmers are being forced off the land or into bankruptcy.&nbsp;Jackson's major solution calls for the development of plant combinations that yield food while holding the soil and re-newing its nutrients without plowing or applying fossil-fuel-based fertilizers or pesticides. His new way of raising crops, by working with the soil's natural systems, would keep the world's bread-basket producing perpetually.</p><p>Wes Jackson and his wife, Dana, are directors of the Land Institute, a research and educational organization near Salina, Kansas, where they are currently breeding seed-producing perennials that could revolutionize world and American agriculture within fifty years."<i>New Roots for Agriculture</i> is a landmark. . . .

Turning his face toward the east, First Lieutenant Nathan Dixon sat on the hood of the battalion S-3's Humvee. With his feet planted firmly on the vehicle's front bumper and his arms held tightly across his chest, he watched as the pale sun grudgingly began its ascent into the eastern sky. Like everything else in this part of the world, Nathan thought, even the sun is dragging its tail.With a sigh, the young officer closed his eyes, leaned his head back, and slowly rotated it in an effort to get the kinks out of his neck. The day had hardly begun and yet he had been up and on the road for better than three hours. Breakfast, and Fort Apache, his unit's basecamp, was still an hour away. Opening his eyes, the young battalion staff officer looked out over the abandoned farm fields that surrounded them. These liaison trips back to brigade, he decided, were no longer much of a diversion from the daily grind that had come to dominate his life. They were six months into their deployment with nothing to look forward to but another six months of doing the exact same thing, day in, day out. He, and the rest of the 2nd Brigade, would have to go through the motions of performing a mission that no longer made sense, using rules of engagement that kept them from having any effect, in a country no one much cared about, while living among a people who weren't particularly interested in having them there.Assigned to the 2nd Battalion of the 13th Infantry just as it was in the throes of deploying to the Slovak Republic, Nathan Dixon was sent to the place where all surplus combat arms officers are dumped, the unit's S-3 shop. Chiefly responsible for planning the operations of a unit, S-3 sections are notorious for being the home of an eclectic collection of officers and NCOs. In just about any unit's operations section, you'll find one or two stallions, primarily officers, waiting for a chance, any chance, to charge off to a new, more challenging assignment somewhere else. Working side by side with these are the nags of a unit, officers and NCOs who had not quite measured up to the demands of their last duty position, but were not bad enough to warrant elimination. Holding this mismatched assortment of personalities together is the primary function of the operations sergeant. This man, by necessity, is something akin to a miracle worker, expected to do anything and everything, with absolutely nothing, by yesterday. If stress, frustration, overwork, and too many demands put forth by too many people were the primary cause of baldness, the head of every operations sergeant in the United States Army would be as smooth as a cue ball.At first Nathan didn't much mind being thrown intothis mix of professional fast movers and has-beens. Having just left an airborne unit, the young first lieutenant was somewhat out of his element in a mechanized infantry battalion. Distances that had required his footborne parachute infantrymen the better part of a day to march were covered in less than an hour by soldiers mounted in Bradley fighting vehicles. Even the sharpest young officer required a bit of time for his view of the world, and in particular the battlefield, to make this sort of adjustment. So his assignment to the S-3 shop had been, even in his own opinion, not all bad. Slowly, however, as Nathan mastered his duties and became familiar with the idiosyncrasies of mounted warfare, the limitations of his post began to press in upon him. Like any young eagle that had learned to fly, he did not take well to being caged.The people he worked for, having been there themselves, helped make Nathan's stay in staff purgatory as painless as they could. Major Jon Sergeant, the operations officer, was quick to see that Nathan had a keen eye for terrain, an intuitive grasp of tactics, and a habit of being brutally honest. Whenever he needed someone to check out a reported incident, to recon a site for a new checkpoint, or to run to brigade or other units, the S-3 sent young Dixon. On occasion, he even allowed the energetic officer to slip away and attach himself to one of the line companies as they went about trying to enforce a peace accord that only the peacekeepers seemed interested in. Yet these diversions from the daily routine were only that, diversions. At the beginning of each day, Nathan found himself right back where he had been the day before; a third-echelon staff weenie commanding nothing more than a folding chair and half of a field desk.Glancing over into the field where his driver had wandered in order to relieve himself, Nathan was about to ask if the man was having problems when he heard tracked vehicles coming down the road. Sitting up, helooked to the front, toward the east, to see if they were coming from that direction. When he saw nothing, he stood up, carefully balancing himself on the Humvee's fender and looking to the rear, over the roof of the vehicle. There, off in the distance, he saw a squat, full-tracked vehicle headed down the road toward them. Behind it were several trucks, two, perhaps more."Hey, Harvey," Dixon called out to the driver, "you'd better pick up the pace and finish whatever it is you're doing. We have company."Turning his head, the Humvee driver looked over at Nathan, then down the road in the direction his passenger was staring. When he saw the approaching column, the young soldier began to do his best to bring his business to a conclusion.When the lead vehicle was about a thousand meters away, Nathan recognized it for what it was, a BMP. Hopping down off his perch, he walked over to his side of the Humvee, reached into the vehicle, and pulled out the hand mike to the radio. Keying the radio by depressing the push-to-talk button on the side of the mike, he called brigade operations. "Foxtrot niner seven. Foxtrot niner seven. This is Kilo eight five Bravo, over."Releasing the button, he waited for the NCO on duty at brigade to acknowledge. "Kilo eight five Bravo, this is Foxtrot niner seven. Send your traffic, over.""This is Kilo eight five Bravo. Are there any Slovakian Army units scheduled to be operating or moving about in sector today, over.""This is Foxtrot niner seven. Wait one, over."While Nathan waited for the radio telephone operator, or RTO, at brigade to pass the question on to a duty NCO, Nathan reached into the Humvee to fish out his rifle. Even though the Slovakians showed American soldiers little in the way of respect, they were even more contemptuous of one who was unarmed.From the speaker, the voice of the RTO at brigade called out. "Kilo eight five Bravo, that's a negative. Noauthorizations have been approved for the movement of any Slovakian units in our sector, over."Drawing in a deep breath, Nathan keyed the mike as he contemplated what he knew would follow. "Foxtrot niner seven, be advised, we have a column of Slovakian Army trucks, number unknown, led by a BMP-1, moving east on the road at grid ..." Then, realizing that he hadn't bothered to check their location before starting his report, Nathan quickly added, "Wait, over."Leaning inside the Humvee, the young officer looked up at the GPS that was attached to the frame of the windshield. Hitting the display button for their current location, Nathan watched as the letters and digits representing their location on the ground flashed across the tiny screen. These he passed on to brigade. In return, the RTO dutifully read off instructions as to what Nathan was expected to do. "You will halt and detain all violators of the Munich Accords. You are to provide this headquarters with the name, rank, and unit of the senior officer in charge of the force violating the Accords. In addition, you will provide this headquarters with the number of troops present, how they are armed, and the vehicular composition of the unit in violation of the Munich Accords and await further instructions, over."Without bothering to use the call signs, and with a bit more sarcasm in his voice than he meant to use, Nathan came back, "I do hope you realize that it's just me and my driver out here."To this, the RTO came back with, "<i>Vaya con Dios, amigo.</i>"Angered by the stupidity of their standing orders as well as the hopelessness of enforcing any sort of peace in this region, Dixon threw the hand mike back into the Humvee just as Harvey, the driver, was climbing into his seat. "I see brigade gave you the standard 'Hold until relieved' spiel.""Yep," Nathan replied in disgust as he watched the column draw closer."So what do we do, LT?" Harvey asked as he prepared to start the Humvee. "I hope it's pull pitch and get the frog outta here."Drawing a deep breath, Nathan began to make his way around to the rear of the Humvee."'Fraid not, GI. We got our orders.""If you ask me, sir," the concerned driver went on as he followed Nathan's movement around his Humvee, "the poor shmucks who followed Custer had their orders too. But that didn't mean they were smart to follow them.""Well, Harvey," Nathan said as he stepped out into the road, "I didn't ask you. Now, get on the radio with brigade. Stay with them, and keep alert."The driver was still trying to think of a snappy comeback when the lead BMP came trundling up to Nathan. As with so many incidents like this in the past few weeks, the driver of the BMP continued forward, refusing to hit his brakes until it became clear that Nathan wasn't going to give way. High risk games of chicken such as this, between the Slovakian Army and the NATO peacekeepers, had become the order of the day. For the NATO troops deployed in southwestern Slovakia, it was the only option they had under rules of engagement that had done nothing to keep the Slovakians from carrying out their program of ethnic cleansing. For the Slovakians, it was their way of demonstrating their total disregard for the NATO troops and their mission, a mission that had, to date, failed to accomplish any of its stated goals.Nathan, like his fellow American peacekeepers, had no desire to lay down his life trying to enforce an accord that his own government was anxious to see fade away. Unlike Bosnia, where a one-year commitment had become an albatross that hung around the Army's neck for the better part of a decade, the American role in this NATO mission to Slovakia would be for one year and one year only. If, in that time, the conflict betweenthe Slovakian government and its ethnic Hungarian minority had not been sorted out, the Americans, at the behest of their Congress, were prepared to walk away from it and leave whatever else needed to be done there for the Europeans to finish. Still, while they were there, soldiers like Nathan were expected to carry out their assigned duties, no matter how ridiculous, or hazardous, they sometimes became.When the BMP finally came to a full stop, it sat little more than a foot away from where Nathan stood. For his part, the young battalion staff officer, having been prepared to leap out of the way, relaxed, but only a little. The commander of the BMP, hanging out of his open hatch, waved furiously at Nathan as he ordered the American to get out of the way. Sprinkled in with his demands were threats and a few curses that Nathan was able to pick out. This only reinforced Nathan's resolve to stand firm, presenting his own demands in English. "This troop movement has not been sanctioned by NATO. I demand to see your commanding officer." Ignoring Nathan, the commander of the BMP continued to wave his arm wildly, adding more and coarser expletives to his dialogue.This pointless exchange continued for several minutes, until a Slovakian officer, flanked by half a dozen soldiers clutching AKs to their chests, stepped out from behind the BMP. "What seems to be the problem here?" the Slovakian captain demanded."Sir," Nathan stated in a crisp, commanding tone. "This troop movement has not been sanctioned by NATO. If you are the commanding officer of this unit, I must have your name, rank, and the identification of this organization."The Slovakian captain forced a smile. "I think not, lieutenant.""Sir," Nathan insisted, "these demands are not negotiable. They are spelled out in the Munich Accords and must be obeyed.""If you had bothered to study those Accords, lieutenant," the Slovakian officer explained, "you would find that not a single official of my government affixed his signature to them. Therefore, your precious Accords have no meaning to me. Now, you are blocking the road. You will step aside.""I cannot do that, sir."The smile disappeared from the Slovakian's face. "Then you leave me no choice but to remove you."Seeing that the moment of truth was at hand, Nathan tightened his grip on his M-16. This action caught the attention of the six soldiers who were backing the Slovakian captain. In response, they took one step closer to their officer, lowering the muzzles of their weapons as they did so.From behind him, Nathan heard his driver call out. "Sir, brigade is on the radio. They need to talk to you right now."Nathan stood there, glaring at the Slovakian captain for another moment before pivoting about smartly on his heels. Hoping that the other officer hadn't seen the beads of sweat that were beginning to form, the young staff officer walked away from the Slovakian and his consorts. Taking his time, Nathan walked over to the Humvee, going around to the passenger side. Taking advantage of his absence, the Slovakian captain signaled the commander of the BMP to move out.At the Humvee, Nathan stuck his head into the vehicle, but made no effort to take the hand mike from his driver. "Does brigade really want to talk to me?" the young officer asked quietly.Shaking his head, Harvey whispered, "No, sir."Nathan smiled broadly as he looked out the rear window. The Slovakian captain and his men had already mounted up and were preparing to follow the BMP. "Good move, Harvey. I owe you one."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>FORT APACHEAFTERNOON, FEBRUARY 4By the time the convoy made its way past the sandbag bunkers that flanked the main entrance to Fort Apache, Second Lieutenant Gerald Reider's spirit had pretty much been beaten to death. Thus far, nothing he had experienced during his long journey even came close to matching his expectation. The infectious high that had inflamed Reider and his fellow officers after they had completed the rigors of Ranger training had been followed too closely by their introduction to the "real" Army.The long road that took Gerald Reider from Fort Benning, Georgia, to the gates of this battalion outpost in south central Slovakia had been slow and tortuous. It started with the charter flight that transported Reider and some four hundred fellow soldiers, airmen, and their families from the United States to Germany. While the young second lieutenant of infantry had no delusions that he was about to become a rather small fish in the overall scheme of the military universe, Reider was not prepared for the indifference, bordering on disdain, that he ran into as he began his travels. It seemed that no matter what line he stood in, Reider found himself waiting between a mother with small, impatient children and an enlisted soldier who had somehow managed to make it though basic training without eve...</p><h2>Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent</h2><p>The personal story of the actor who portrayed Rent&#39;s Mark Cohen covers such topics as his Broadway successes, his grief at the death of the production&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning creator, and his struggles with his mother&#39;s life-threatening illness. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Anthony Rapp</b> has been acting professionally since he was nine years old.

He has appeared in numerous films, including <i>Adventures in Babysitting, Dazed and Confused,</i> the Oscar-winning <i>A Beautiful Mind,</i> and, most recently, the film adaptation of <i>Rent.</i> In 2000, he released his debut album, <i>Look Around.</i> He lives in New York City with his partner, Rodney To, and their three cats, Emma, Sebastian, and Spike.

Although Rapp spends too much time whining about his relationship with a cruel lover and depicting his vigil at his mother's bedside, he delves deeply, with real emotion, into the making of a blockbuster show, providing details that any show-biz buff will adore. No matter the flaws, the climax is an unabashed tearjerker. What's missing is the music.

What were once simple quandaries now seemed to come equipped with trapdoors. One misstep and you&#x2019;d tumble into the chute of doom, where demotions became terminations, homeowners became squatters, and Little Bandit was no longer safe. I was no exception. I too had problems. Multitudes of problems. If something could go wrong, it usually did. The only law that seemed to apply to me was Mr. Murphy&#x2019;s. For a long while, decades even, the sun had shone upon me. Life had been an effortless glide. I&#x2019;d traveled the world, married my soul mate, sired two strapping boys, and wrote books that&#x2014; I&#x2019;ve been confidently informed&#x2014;landed on the bestseller list in Eugene, Oregon. I couldn&#x2019;t explain why good things happened to me. They just did. But then, like a bad Chinese proverb, my good fortune evaporated like a spilled Slurpee in a Phoenix parking lot. <i>Everything that could go wrong</i> . . . was not a thought I dared to finish. It could always get worse, and usually it did.</p><p>What&#x2019;d happened? I wondered. Good luck seeks no antecedent, but bad luck demands an inquest. Was it simply written in the cosmos? Did the yin of happiness necessitate the yang of misery? Could it simply be bad karma? No, I thought, as I reflected on the causes of my misfortune. Behind every event, every circumstance, lay a cold, hard trail of facts. I needed only to follow the breadcrumbs of past experience to bring me to the source of my tribulations. And there, sadly, I found something immense and unmovable:</p><p>Continents.</p><p>Bad things happened to me on large land masses. Terrible things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a most unfortunate realization, of course. How I&#x2019;d hoped to discover an unhappy childhood, an unjust prison sentence, or a soul-scarring bout of acne to explain the recent trajectory of my life. Who wants to blame their woes on something as inalterable as the North American tectonic plate? After all, continents are&#x2014; at the very least&#x2014; nice to look at. I too could admire majestic, snow-glazed mountains, the rivers that flowed with the tide of history, the buzz of the megacity. I am, for the record, appreciative of boreal forests and rain forests, deserts, and the vast expanse of the northern tundra. I like New York <i>and </i>Los Angeles, as well as Mumbai, Shanghai, and Dubai. I am fond of small towns. Also apple pie and yak, though not together. All this can be found on continents. But, alas, experience tells me that if I&#x2019;m not surrounded by an ocean, my life crumbles like a stale cookie.</p><p>It&#x2019;s true.</p><p>Take my most recent sojourn in North America. I&#x2019;d protected my well-being by living on a peninsula. Surrounded by water on three sides, I navigated the perils of the modern world, and whenever events or situations threatened to leave my eyes agog and my head a- splitting, I retreated to a rented sailboat, where secure in a finite space surrounded by the infinite blue of the ocean, I navigated pitching waves and morning fog with an aplomb that failed me on dry land. On water I was free and sure; on land I felt like a lost fish. But then, chasing a job, I moved deeper into the continent, distant from familiar waters and sandy dunes, and there I fell.</p><p><br>Into the bottle to be precise. This wasn&#x2019;t entirely unexpected. In retrospect, it was probably a foregone conclusion. I&#x2019;d always had a temperamental shut-off valve. Open-minded to the mind-altering, I&#x2019;d long ago learned to be wary of the seductive offerings of both the street and the pharmacy. I&#x2019;d known that drugs could be a problem and that it was best to dispense with the experimentation early on. I pretty much maxed out on magic mushrooms. Instead, I&#x2019;d settled into the steady companionship of pint glasses and decanters. Like everyone. It was normal, no? A few beers at the bar; wine with dinner. It was all good. In fact, hard liquor was a no-no in my world&#x2014; until, eventually, it wasn&#x2019;t, and there was that unknown moment when the proverbial invisible line was crossed, when everything started to tumble with a terrifying ferocity, and despite untold As-God-Is-My-Witness promises to get this under control, to show some restraint, I couldn&#x2019;t. I couldn&#x2019;t stop. Not until my wife, bless her, deposited me at rehab, where, sedated with Librium, I learned that lucky-ducky that I was, I had a fatal brain disease and should I ever pick up a drink again I might as well put five bullets in a six-shooter and shove it down my piehole.</p><p>So this was bad.

Decadence and boredom, most likely, is what the commander of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Moscow Police thinks, but still he finds it curious enough to send the newest member of the division, Erast Fandorin, a young man of irresistible charm, to the Alexander Gardens precinct for more information. <br><br>Fandorin is not satisfied with the conclusion that this is an open-and-shut case, nor with the preliminary detective work the precinct has done&#x2014;and for good reason: The bizarre and tragic suicide is soon connected to a clear case of murder, witnessed firsthand by Fandorin. There are many unresolved questions. Why, for instance, have both victims left their fortunes to an orphanage run by the English Lady Astair? And who is the beautiful &#x201c;A.B.,&#x201d; whose signed photograph is found in the apparent suicide&#x2019;s apartment? Relying on his keen intuition, the eager sleuth plunges into an investigation that leads him across Europe, landing him at the deadly center of a terrorist conspiracy of worldwide proportions.<br><br>In this thrilling mystery that brings nineteenth-century Russia to vivid life, Akunin has created one of the most eagerly anticipated novels in years.</p><p>&#x201c;Mystery readers should enjoy this story. It is as Russian, and as international, as caviar and vodka! A crafty tale full of atmosphere, character, and action.

All those having business in Supreme Court Part 42, State of New York, New York County, draw near and ye shall be heard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pausing his litany, Chief Administrative Court Clerk Duffy McIntyre glared balefully out at the packed courtroom as if daring those in attendance to show the slightest inclination toward unruliness. Having ensured their silence, he continued, &#x201c;The Honorable Supreme Court Justice Vince Dermondy presiding.&#x201d;<br> <br>Short and somewhat pugnacious-looking, Judge Dermondy immediately entered through the door leading from the judge&#x2019;s robing room and took his seat up on his dais before he, too, turned his attention to those in attendance. He glanced with his intense gray-blue eyes first at the defense table, then the prosecution, and finally beyond them to the gallery.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my understanding that we have a verdict, and I want to take a moment before the jury is brought in to warn each and every one of you that I will not tolerate any outbursts, demonstrations, or statements directed at anyone present. I understand full well the implications of this verdict whatever the jury has decided, but I expect&#x2014;no, demand&#x2014;that the decorum of this courtroom and these proceedings be respected. Am . . . I . . . clear?&#x201d;<br> <br>Under his glower, the audience nodded as one. Most had already seen this judge in action after a group of protesters managed to find seats in the courtroom on the first day of the trial and began hurling politically charged invectives when the People&#x2019;s case was introduced. Then partway through the trial, Dermondy had a reporter for one of the Washington newspapers taken into custody after the journalist approached a juror for a quote, which the judge followed with the dismissal of another juror when it came to light that she had contacted a book publisher and offered to sell her story.<br> <br>No one had taken any chances with the judge since. Dermondy nodded. &#x201c;Good, you may be seated.&#x201d; He turned to ï¿½McIntyre. &#x201c;Please inform the jurors that we&#x2019;re ready for them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of all the people in the courtroom, the only one not intimidated by the judge was Roger &#x201c;Butch&#x201d; Karp, who stood at his customary place behind the prosecution table. As the district attorney of New York County, he was a firm believer in the sanctity of court proceedings and appreciated a judge who felt the same way. He&#x2019;d inherited that view from his first boss, the legendary DA Francis Garrahy.<br> <br>As such, he didn&#x2019;t see the proceedings as a game or contest between attorneys jockeying for unfair advantages and pulling out all stops to &#x201c;win&#x201d; a conviction. He believed that as a prosecutor, his job entailed a solemn, sacred search for the truth.<br> <br>Truth. Karp thought about how little that word meant to the three men standing across the aisle from him behind the defense table. Two attorneys and the defendant, a man who was on trial not just for murder, but metaphorically for murdering the truth. In Karp&#x2019;s book that was the same as committing treason.<br> <br>Karp looked down at the omnipresent yellow legal pad on the table. On its lined sheets was his outline of the People&#x2019;s case&#x2014;witness by witness, evidence connected to more evidence&#x2014;with notes in the margins as issues or thoughts arose so that he forgot nothing, missed no detail from his opening statement to his final summation.<br> <br>As he moved through the trial, each page served its purpose and was then folded over and paper-clipped to the cardboard backing. All that was left now was the final page of his summation. Or rather, the last two notes he&#x2019;d made to remind himself of what he&#x2019;d wanted to end the case on.<br> <br>At the top of the page was the word &#x201c;infamy&#x201d; and a series of other terms that to him defined the word as it applied to this case. It had come to him the evening before closing summations as he&#x2019;d pondered how to get the jurors to understand the full implications of this crime, this criminal. &#x201c;End result . . . ï¿½unbridled ambition . . . weak character . . . duplicitous . . . their own enrichment politically and otherwise.&#x201d;<br> <br>The last line of the page, as well as of his summation, was a partial quote from Mark Twain. &#x201c;A truth is not hard to kill . . . a lie well told is immortal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Karp looked over at the defense team and their client. They lived in a world of well-told lies. It was the whole reason they were all in the courtroom on a summer day in New York City waiting for a jury to render its verdict. The entire defense had been composed of more well-told lies. And the infamy of it was that these lies cut to the very heart of the nation&#x2019;s security, all so that a few corrupt men and women could consolidate power, gain enormous wealth, and promote their worldview.<br> <br>The defense attorney kept his eyes focused on the door leading from the jury deliberation room. He&#x2019;d try to read the jurors as they entered for the telltale signs of which way the vote had gone. The defendant also was watching the door but felt Karp&#x2019;s eyes and turned toward him.<br> <br>Up to this moment, the defendant had acted as if the trial hardly mattered to him. It was at worst an inconvenience, an irritation; at best, a joke. Although he was polite to the judge and charming to the jurors, he laughed and joked with his attorney during the breaks, and smiled or even smirked during the People&#x2019;s case. Then he&#x2019;d been the picture of aggrieved and unjustly accused when he took the stand&#x2014;at least until Karp had cross-examined him. But even though he&#x2019;d been knocked up against the ropes, he&#x2019;d remained arrogant and smug in his invincibility.<br> <br>However, now as the jurors shuffled to their assigned seats, most with their heads down, the smirk had disappeared, leaving only a thin sheen of the arrogance. His face was pale, and he licked his thin lips as if suddenly parched. Something else was in his eyes, something different.<br> <br>Doubt, Karp thought. But then the defendant&#x2019;s dark eyes narrowed and filled with hate as he sneered and gave his attention back to the jurors.<br> <br>Unperturbed, Karp half turned and glanced over his shoulder at the bench full of people immediately behind the prosecution table. It was quite the eclectic assembly of characters: his wife, Marlene; his daughter, Lucy; her fiancï¿½, Ned Blanchett; as well as the Taos Indian tracker John Jojola; Vietnamese gangster Tran Van Do; federal antiterrorism agent Espey Jaxon; journalist Ariadne Stupenagel; Richie Bryers, his close high school friend and, as it turned out, a star proseï¿½cution witness; and Detective Clay Fulton of the NYPD. They&#x2019;d all come to witness the final act of an epic tragedy they&#x2019;d unknowingly played a part in during the opening scenes nearly a year earlier.<br> <br>Smiling slightly at his family and friends, Karp then looked out over the rest of the audience in the gallery. Most of the hard wooden benches were crammed with media types attracted to the high-profile case like hyenas to a lion kill and just as excited at the smell of blood in the air. A grim-faced collection of defense supporters, many of them well known in political and show business circles, stared up at the ceiling or glared at Karp from the benches behind the defense table.<br> <br>He was just about to turn around to face the judge when his eyes fastened on a woman sitting in the second row from the back of the courtroom next to the aisle. She was wearing a short dark wig and sunglasses, but he recognized the oval-shaped face and, more than that, the way she carried herself. Like a supremely confident predator, he thought, as he had for many years whenever their paths had crossed. Something told him she&#x2019;d been watching him, but she was now just looking straight ahead at the judge, the slightest smile on her face.<br> <br>Karp frowned at the sudden dilemma her presence created. Sitting in the back of a New York County trial court was a woman who&#x2019;d committed more felonies in and around Manhattan than there were taxicabs in Times Square at rush hour. She was a paid assassin and terrorist for hire. He was the top law enforcement official in New York City, sworn to uphold the law; she was &#x201c;officially&#x201d; on escaped status, but there she was in the flesh.<br> <br>Still, he hesitated. He knew that he should alert Fulton and court security to apprehend her. And yet, he owed her. So did many people who would never know it. Nor would anyone be aware if he chose not to do anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please be seated,&#x201d; Judge Dermondy commanded. He then faced the jury foreman, who sat closest to his dais. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?&#x201d;<br> <br>The jurors all nodded. &#x201c;We have, Your Honor,&#x201d; the foreman said, holding up the verdict forms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. McIntyre, if you please,&#x201d; Dermondy said, indicating that the chief clerk should retrieve the documents and hand them to him. The judge looked down at the documents and after a moment nodded. He turned and addressed the defense table. &#x201c;Will the defendant rise.&#x201d;</p><h2>Tales of First Ladies and Their Quilt Blocks</h2><p>Eleanor&#39;s latest block party comes to life in her new sampler Quilt Book, Tales of First Ladies and Their Quilt Blocks.

Masala&#x2014;the Hindi word for a blend of spices&#x2014;is at the heart of Indian cooking. Whether toasted, ground, fried, infused in oil, or fresh, spices are used to layer flavors in simple but profound ways. Bring the same techniques to American classics such as meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, or roasted turkey, and the result is something truly special. Masala also refers to the excitement and vibrancy that come from a house full of friends and family. Simple recipes prepared with staples found in every supermarket mean less time laboring in the kitchen and more time spent enjoying the spice of life.<br><br>From snacks and starters and on to the evening meal, the Indian influence brightens the flavors in dishes like:<br><br>- Goat Cheese Pesto&#x2013;Stuffed Chicken Breasts<br>- Tamarind-Glazed Turkey with Corn Bread&#x2013;Jalapeï¿½o Stuffing <br>- Crab-and-Salmon Cakes with Spicy Cilantro Aï¿½oli<br>- Crispy Okra Salad<br>- Bombay-Style Whole Snapper<br>- Honey-Glazed Double-Thick Pork Chops<br>- Pistachio-and-Cardamom Pound Cake with Lemon Icing<br>- Fried Eggs with Asparagus and Prosciutto<br><br>American Masala isn&#x2019;t about traditional Indian food&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about adding new flavors to the great American melting pot, using spices to liven up the old standbys, and enjoying dishes that are as exciting and diverse as life in the big city, and yet as familiar and comforting as your mother&#x2019;s cooking.</p><p>Suvir Saran's first book, <i>Indian Home Cooking</i>, offered a you-can-make-it take on one of the world's great cuisines, whose many spice blends, or masalas, can daunt Western cooks.

More traditional Indian dishes, like Sweet Potato Chaat and Lamb Seekh Kebabs, are also included, as are sweets, such as Pistachio-and-Cardamom Pound Cake with Lemon Icing and Pavlova with Spiced Berries and Cointreau Cream. <p> Saran, a warm, food-loving presence, also offers autobiographical notes that further domesticate his recipes.

Knowing one Spanish phrase, he decides to take the ferry to Spain.<br><br>Unbeknownst to Lee, Spain in 1934 was on the verge of war, and, inexorably, he becomes entangled in the passionate, violent and bloody confusion that was the Spanish Civil War.</p><p><b>Laurie Lee </b>was born in 1914 in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and was brought up with his mother and many siblings. At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then traveled on foot through Spain as described in <i>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</i>. He married Catherine Polge and had one daughter; he died in 1997.Originally published in 1969, Lee's charming account of his travels in Spain in 1935 became almost as popular as his delightful Cider with Rosie. This fussily illustrated edition is an insult to an enjoyable prose work by a distinguished poet. Rather than eliciting the Spain that Lee visited, these old-fashioned illustrations from a variety of sources detract from a text that is rendered unreadable by a 34-pica measure, surmounted by running headlines (finically set in caps and italic initial caps), topped by a double line that serves as "walking" surface for a little man with stick (presumably representing the author) who promenades remorselessly across the page, pica by pica, as the reader progresses with the story. Each color illustration is surrounded by a white mat-like area enclosed, in turn, by a triple-rule frame set against a tan backgrounda tacky effect.

Bush, the hugely ambitious Conceptual artist Mark Lombardi was found hanged in his studio, an apparent suicide. With museums lining up to buy his work, and the fame he had sought relentlessly at last within his reach, speculation about whether his death was suicide or murder has titillated the art world ever since. Lombardi was an enigma who was at once a compulsive truth-teller and a cunning player of the art game, a political operative and a stubborn independent, a serious artist and a Merry Prankster, a metaphysicist if not a scientist.<br><br>Lombardi's spidery, elusive diagrams describing the evolution of the shadow-banking industry from a decades-old alliances between intelligence agencies, banking, government and organized crime, may have made him unique in art history as the only artist whose primary subject, the CIA, has turned around and studied him and his art work. Exhaustively researched, this is the first comprehensive biography of this immensely contradictory and brilliantly original artist.</p><p><b>Patricia Goldstone</b> has been a reporter for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and a bureau chief for Cablevision.

When news of Charles Dickens&#x2019;s untimely death reaches the office of his struggling American publisher, Fields &amp; Osgood, partner James Osgood sends his trusted clerk Daniel Sand to await the arrival of Dickens&#x2019;s unfinished novel. But when Daniel&#x2019;s body is discovered by the docks and the manuscript is nowhere to be found, Osgood must embark on a transatlantic quest to unearth the novel that he hopes will save his venerable business and reveal Daniel&#x2019;s killer.<br><br>Danger and intrigue abound on the journey to England, for which Osgood has chosen Rebecca Sand, Daniel&#x2019;s older sister, to assist him. As they attempt to uncover Dickens&#x2019;s final mystery, Osgood and Rebecca find themselves racing the clock through a dangerous web of literary lions and drug dealers, sadistic thugs and blue bloods, and competing members of Dickens&#x2019;s inner circle. They soon realize that understanding Dickens&#x2019;s lost ending is a matter of life and death, and the hidden key to stopping a murderous mastermind.</p><p>Matthew Pearl is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Dante Club</i> and <i>The Poe Shadow</i>, and the editor of the Modern Library editions of <i>Dante&#x2019;s Inferno </i>(translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) and Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s <i>The Murders in the Rue Morgue: The Dupin Tales</i>.

Bengal, India, June 1870</b><br><br>Neither of the young mounted policemen fancied these subdivisions of the Bagirhaut province. Neither of them fancied jungles where all manner of things could happen unprovoked, unseen, as they had a few years before when a poor lieutenant was stripped, clubbed, and drowned in the river for trying to collect licensing taxes.<br><br>The officers clamped the heels of their boots tighter into their horses&#x2019; flanks. Not to say they were scared&#x2014;only careful.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be careful always,&#x201d; said Turner to Mason as they ducked the low branches and vines. &#x201c;Be assured, the natives in India do not value life. Not even as the poorest Englishman does.&#x201d;<br><br>The younger of the two policemen, Mason, nodded thoughtfully at the words of his impressive partner, who was nearly twenty-five years old, who had two brothers also come from England to be in Indian Civil Service, and who had fought the Indian rebellion a few years before. He was an expert if ever one was.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps we should have come with more men, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s pretty! More men, Mason? We shan&#x2019;t need any more than our two heads between us to take in a few ragged dacoits. Remember, a high-mettled horse stands not for hedge nor ditch.&#x201d;<br><br>When Mason had arrived in Bengal from Liverpool for his new post, he accepted Turner&#x2019;s offer to &#x201c;chum,&#x201d; pooling incomes and living expenses and passing their free time in billiards or croquet. Mason, at eighteen, was thankful for counsel from such an experienced man in the ranks of the Bengal police. Turner could list places a policeman ought never to ride alone because of the Coles, the Santhals, the Assamee, the Kookies, and the hill tribes in the frontiers. Some of the criminal gangs among the tribes were dacoits, thieves; others, warned Turner, carried axes and wanted English heads. &#x201c;The natives of India value life only as far as they can kill when doing so,&#x201d; was another Turner proverb.<br><br>Fortunately, they were not hunting out that sort of bloodthirsty gang in these wasting temperatures this morning. Instead they were investigating a plain, brazen robbery. The day before, a long train of twenty or thirty bullock carts had been hit with a shower of stones and rocks. In the chaos, dacoits holding torches tipped over the carts and fled with valuable chests from the convoy. When intelligence of the theft reached the police station, Turner had gone to their supervisor&#x2019;s desk to volunteer himself and Mason, and their commander had sent them to question a known receiver of stolen goods.<br><br>Now, as the terrain thinned, they neared the small thatched house on the creek. A dwindling column of smoke hovered above the mud chimney. Mason gripped the sword at his belt. Every two men in the Bengal police were assigned one sword and one light carbine rifle, and Turner had naturally claimed the rifle.<br><br>&#x201c;Mason,&#x201d; he said with a slight smile in his voice after noticing the anxious look on his partner&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You are green, aren&#x2019;t you? It is highly likely they have unloaded the goods and fled already. Perhaps for the mountains, where our elaka&#x2014;that is like &#x2018;jurisdiction,&#x2019; Mason&#x2014;where our elaka does not extend. No matter, really, when captured, they lie and say they are innocent peasants until the corrupt darkie magistrates release them. What do you say to going tiger shooting upon some elephants?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Turner!&#x201d; Mason whispered, just then, interrupting his partner.<br><br>They were coming upon the thatched-roof house where a bright red horse was tied to a post (the natives in these provinces often painted their horses unnatural colors). A slight rustle at the house drew their eyes to a pair of men fitting the description of two of the thieves. One of them held a torch. They were arguing.<br><br>Turner signaled Mason to stay quiet. &#x201c;The one on the right, it&#x2019;s Narain,&#x201d; he whispered and pointed. Narain was a known opium thief against whom several attempts at conviction had failed.<br><br>The opium poppy was cultivated in Bengal and refined there under English control, after which the colonial government sold the drug at auction to opium traders from England, America, and other nations. From there, the traders would transport the opium for sale to China, where it was illegal but still in great demand. The trade was enormously profitable for the British government.<br><br>Dismounting, Turner and Mason split up and approached the thieves from two sides. As Mason crept through the bushes from around the back, he could not help but think about their good fortune: not only that two of the thieves were still at the suspected ?confederate&#x2019;s house but also that their argument was serving as distraction.<br><br>As Mason made his way around the thick shrubbery he jumped out at Turner&#x2019;s signal and displayed his sword at the surprised Narain, who put up two trembling hands and lay flat on the ground. Meanwhile the other thief had pushed Turner down and dashed into the dense trees. Turner staggered to his feet, aimed his rifle, and shot. He fired a wild second shot into the jungle.<br><br>They tied the prisoner and traced the fugitive&#x2019;s path but soon lost the trail. While searching up and down the curve of the rough creek, Turner lunged at something on the ground. Upon reaching the spot, Mason saw with great pride in his chum that Turner had bludgeoned a cobra with his carbine. But the cobra was not dead and it rose up again as Mason approached and tried to strike. Such was the peril of the Bengalee jungle.<br><br>Abandoning the hunt for the other thief, they returned to the spot where they&#x2019;d left Narain tied to a tree and freed him, leading him as they took the horses they&#x2019;d borrowed back to the police outpost. There, they boarded the train with their prisoner in tow to bring Narain to the district of their station house.<br><br>&#x201c;Get some sleep,&#x201d; Turner said to Mason with a brotherly care. &#x201c;You look worn out. I can guard the dacoit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Turner,&#x201d; said Mason gratefully.<br><br>The eventful morning had been exhausting. Mason found an empty row of seats and covered his face with his hat. Before long he fell into a deep sleep beneath the rattling window, where a slow breeze made the compartment nearly tolerable. He woke to a horrible echoing scream&#x2014;the kind that lived sometimes in his nightmares of Bengal&#x2019;s jungles.<br><br>When he shook himself into sensibility he saw Turner standing alone staring out the window.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the prisoner?&#x201d; Mason cried.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201d; Turner shouted, a wild glint in his eyes. &#x201c;I looked the other way for a moment, and Narain must have thrown himself out the window!&#x201d;<br><br>They pulled the alarm for the train to stop. Mason and Turner, with the help of an Indian railway policeman, searched along the rocks and found Narain&#x2019;s crushed and bloody body. His head had been smashed open at impact. His hands were still tied together with wire.<br><br>Solemnly, Mason and Turner abandoned the body and reboarded the train. The young English officers were silent the remaining train ride to the station house, except for some unmusical humming by Turner. They had almost reached the terminal when Turner posed a question.<br><br>&#x201c;Answer me this, Mason. Why did you enroll in the mounted police?&#x201d;<br><br>Mason tried to think of a good answer but was too troubled. &#x201c;To raise a little dust, I suppose. We all want to make some noise in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stuff!&#x201d; said Turner. &#x201c;Never lose sight of the true blessings of public service. Each one of us is here to turn out a better civilization in the end, and for that reason alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Turner, about what happened today . . .&#x201d; The younger man&#x2019;s face was white.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Turner demanded. &#x201c;Luck was with us. That cobra might have done us both in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Narain . . . the suspected dacoit. Well, shouldn&#x2019;t we, I mean, to collect up the names and statements of the passengers for our diaries so that if there is any kind of inquiry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Suspected? Guilty, you meant. Never mind, Mason. We&#x2019;ll send one of the native men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But, won&#x2019;t we, if Dickens, I mean . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What mumbling! You oughtn&#x2019;t chew your words.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; the younger officer enunciated forcefully, &#x201c;considering for a moment Dickens&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mason, that&#x2019;s enough! Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m tired?&#x201d; Turner hissed.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; Mason said, nodding.<br><br>Turner&#x2019;s neck had become stiff and veiny at the sound of that particular name: Dickens. As though the word had been rotting deep inside him and now crawled back up his throat.</p><h2>Cold Welcome (Vatta&#39;s Peace)</h2><p><b>Nebula Award&#x2013;winning author Elizabeth Moon makes a triumphant return to science fiction with a thrilling series featuring Kylara Vatta, the daring hero of her acclaimed Vatta&#x2019;s War sequence.</b><br><br> After nearly a decade away, Nebula Award&#x2013;winning author Elizabeth Moon makes a triumphant return to science fiction with this installment in a thrilling new series featuring the daring hero of her acclaimed Vatta&#x2019;s War sequence.<br><br> Summoned to the home planet of her family&#x2019;s business empire, space-fleet commander Kylara Vatta is told to expect a hero&#x2019;s welcome.

Once there, she would have to assume the role of Grand Admiral Vatta, homecoming hero of the recent war. But here, between the place she had made for ï¿½herself&#x2014;ï¿½as founder and commander of Space Defense Force&#x2014;ï¿½and the welcome that awaited her, she had a short time to deal with her own feelings.<br><br>She did not want to be here. She did not want to be anywhere near Slotter Key. She felt nothing warm or sentimental about her home planet, the city she knew so well, or the lost home in which she had grown up. She did not want the good memories to rise, because with them would come the immediacy and certainty of loss.<br><br>No, she wanted to be very far away, on a completely different planet, where the only person who knew all her secrets was equally eager to leave his old memories behind. Rafael Dunbarger, now CEO of the vast InterStellar Communications, had also survived family loss and treachery. Ky knew her darker side would not shock Rafe, as his did not shock her.<br><br>Rafe was born into wealth and privilege, son of a rising ISC executive; his accidental killing of a would-ï¿½be kidnapper had consigned him to a vicious reform school. After that, his family had paid him an allowance to leave the planet, and he&#x2019;d supplemented that remittance in various shady ways. Eventually, his father began using him as a company spy. When his father, mother, and sister were taken hostage, Rafe had organized their rescue. Finally, he&#x2019;d succeeded to his father&#x2019;s job, as CEO of ISC.<br><br>Despite a difference in age and background, Ky thought, they matched well: both had killed, and both had enjoyed it. Both liked&#x2014;ï¿½needed&#x2014;ï¿½excitement. Both admitted to being bored with the routine of a desk job. They had planned a getaway several times, had been within a day of leaving for it, when this had come up.<br><br>This being Great-ï¿½Aunt Grace Lane Vatta, eldest surviving member of the Vatta family and Ky&#x2019;s childhood nemesis, always critical and nosy. While Ky was far away, Grace had been appointed the head of Slotter Key&#x2019;s Department of Defense: the Rector. But Grace Lane Vatta had not used that as a reason to demand Ky&#x2019;s return to Slotter Key. No, this was a family crisis, some legal complication involving Vatta&#x2019;s commercial empire in which Ky still owned a large block of shares.<br><br>So Grace insisted, as she always had, and Ky obeyed, as she always had, resentfully. And that&#x2014;ï¿½her inability to just say no, politely but firmly&#x2014;ï¿½infuriated Ky. She was an admiral now. She had commanded fleets, won battles against high odds. And to cave because an old . . . even in thought, she dared not say anything but old woman . . . had said &#x201c;Come&#x201d; was intolerable. The words she might have said, should have said, ran through her mind again.<br><br>Then her implant dropped a microgram of neuroactive into her brain&#x2019;s circulation and she felt her breathing and heart rate slow again. She turned in her seat, looking across at Jen Bentik, her aide. Commander Bentik, since Jen was so very Cascadian, so very committed to that particular and demanding level of correct behavior. Fifteen years older than Ky, and a head taller, she had been Ky&#x2019;s aide for almost a standard year&#x2014;ï¿½another problem Ky needed to deal with.<br><br>Jen had been watching her, a line between her perfectly shaped brows indicating concern. &#x201c;Does it look familiar, Admiral?&#x201d;<br><br>Ky nodded. &#x201c;A lot of water, a lot of islands. Very different from Cascadia, for sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I still think it would have been more appropriate for you to take Vanguard&#x2019;s shuttle down to the surface,&#x201d; Jen said, changing the topic. In her mind, Ky&#x2019;s status in the Space Defense Force gave her the right to land an SDF shuttle anywhere she pleased.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t bother me,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;They see sending up a Spaceforce shuttle as a military honor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose. I don&#x2019;t mean to be critical of your home planet, ï¿½Admiral&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d; Really? Jen had so far been critical about Slotter Key&#x2019;s every detail, as Ky shared them. &#x201c;But it seems to me that they&#x2019;re not quite&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d; Jen paused.<br><br>&#x201c;Up to Cascadian standards?&#x201d; Ky asked. Jen flushed; her lips thinned. Ky sighed inwardly. She had needed an aide: an admiral&#x2019;s life in peacetime was far more complicated than she had imagined, and Jen was efficient, organized, and capable of handling many situations Ky found difficult. But Jen didn&#x2019;t stop there. She assumed her own sober middle age and Cascadian background gave her license to treat Ky like the child of uncouth barbarians when they were alone. &#x201c;I did tell you,&#x201d; Ky said, keeping her voice light and pleasant, &#x201c;Slotter Key&#x2019;s a lot more casual. You will find it difficult, I expect, at least at first.&#x201d;<br><br>Up came Jen&#x2019;s hackles, so easily raised. &#x201c;I will be perfectly polite.&#x201d; In a tone that meant she was still angry.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. You always are.&#x201d; Impossible to explain to someone who had never been outside her own culture that another set of rules might be legitimate. The last visit to Moray had been marred by Jen&#x2019;s complaints that it was not like Cascadia. This was the core reason she&#x2019;d planned to change aides soon. &#x201c;If someone&#x2019;s being rude&#x2014;ï¿½rude in Slotter Key terms&#x2014;ï¿½I&#x2019;ll make it clear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t have etiquette books? To warn strangers about the rules?&#x201d; Cascadia handed every arriving passenger a thick book of rules, and no one could leave the ship until they had agreed to abide by them or face a court. Ky had never found another system so obsessed with etiquette.<br><br>&#x201c;We do&#x2014;ï¿½did&#x2014;ï¿½but they&#x2019;re mostly for children. For adults, it&#x2019;s a matter of mutual negotiation. There&#x2019;s no legal standard. In my religion&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½the one she didn&#x2019;t follow anymore&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201c;it&#x2019;s important not to take offense unless offense is meant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will do my best, Admiral,&#x201d; Jen said, as if picking up a burden almost too heavy to carry.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain you will,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;You always do.&#x201d; Ky&#x2019;s skullphone pinged. Her flagship&#x2019;s captain, Pordre, reported that a Slotter Key Spaceforce shuttle had arrived at the main space station. &#x201c;Thank you, Captain,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t be any time wasted, then.&#x201d; She looked out the viewport, now in a better mood, though whether from her implant&#x2019;s chemicals or Pordre&#x2019;s report she did not know. She could see ships docked at the space station clearly; several Vatta ships clustered together in Vatta&#x2019;s dedicated section. Back to normal, then&#x2014;ï¿½another sign of Stella&#x2019;s fitness to run the family business.<br><br>When she&#x2019;d left Slotter Key, she&#x2019;d been a disgraced former cadet, a political embarrassment to be whisked away out of reach of the media as quickly as possible. How naï¿½ve she&#x2019;d been, how easily fooled by a first-ï¿½year cadet asking for help, how blind to the political implications. She wouldn&#x2019;t make that mistake again, though she should probably expect someone to bring up that mess. Most wouldn&#x2019;t. Aunt Grace had told her she was billed as a hero returning in triumph. A trickle of humor rose. Maybe it wouldn&#x2019;t be that bad to come home for a few days; it surely couldn&#x2019;t be worse than her departure had been.<br><br>Below the viewport, the familiar shapes of continents and island chains passed in review. Port Major, the oldest city and planetary capital, was obscured by thick clouds, but north of it on Voruksland&#x2019;s east coast, she picked out Grinock Bay, center of an extinct volcano. She&#x2019;d never been there. Corleigh, the island her family had lived on, Port Major on the mainland, and her uncle&#x2019;s country home southwest of Port Major: that was the extent of her onplanet experience.<br><br>She turned from the viewport again; Jen handed her the latest memtip. Ky uploaded it to her implant. The schedule for the rest of the day; the draft of the speech she would give at dinner that evening; the faces and names of notables who would greet her after landing onplanet or be seated at the same table at dinner. For one of them, she needed no memtip: the Commandant of Slotter Key&#x2019;s military academy.<br><br>She could have done without that. The last time she&#x2019;d seen him, he&#x2019;d told her she must resign. Now she was an admiral at only twenty-ï¿½nine, and from a political point of view&#x2014;ï¿½something she had learned to recognize&#x2014;ï¿½she represented one of the Academy&#x2019;s triumphs. It was bound to be awkward.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Jen,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your usual excellent briefing.&#x201d; Jen nodded.<br><br>The pinnace docked smoothly. Ky stood when the light came on, and the pinnace pilot came into the cabin. &#x201c;Good flight, Morey,&#x201d; she said to him.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be back to pick you up anytime, Admiral,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just let us know.&#x201d;<br><br>That was another thing about this visit. Open-ï¿½ended, Aunt Grace had said. It might take longer than planned. No longer than necessary, she told herself. Her life was elsewhere. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you know the moment I know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t plan to take a vacation down there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want us to wait until you&#x2019;ve boarded the shuttle?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No need. It&#x2019;s already docked. I&#x2019;ll be fine. Captain Pordre has all my contact codes.&#x201d; All but one, the very secret one she shared only with Rafe Dunbarger.<br><br>Jen Bentik stood aside as Ky walked to the hatch. All lights green. A perfect match, and thus no reason to worry. She worried anyway. The past few years had given her every reason for caution and few for complacency. She still wore her personal armor under her clothes; she still carried a loaded weapon in all circumstances.<br><br>The hatch opened into a standard air lock. Beyond was the ramp down into the station itself, where the Commandant&#x2014;ï¿½erect as ever but showing his age now&#x2014;ï¿½awaited her. Professionally impassive, of course, the telltale eyelid not drooping today, and his gaze boring into her like an industrial laser. To either side, behind him, rows of media reps were held back by station security.<br><br>&#x201c;Admiral Vatta,&#x201d; he said. Nothing in his tone but courtesy; the sawtooth edge to his voice that had greeted her at their last meeting was undetectable. She had no doubt he could still deploy it. &#x201c;Welcome to Slotter Key. The Rector of Defense and the President both asked me to convey their sincere regrets that they could not meet you here.&#x201d;<br><br>She had wondered if he would call her by her rank&#x2014;ï¿½the rank she had assumed of necessity, not through the usual process of regular promotions overseen by a Board. But of course he did in front of the media. The snakelike tendrils of media feeds hovered over them both. People onplanet would be watching it live. It made her skin itch, but she had the experience now to handle it as blandly as he did.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Commandant.&#x201d; He had a last name, but no one ever used it. &#x201c;I am delighted to meet you again.&#x201d;<br><br>His smile held a glimmer of warmth. &#x201c;And I you, Admiral.&#x201d; He glanced aside, and two of the enlisted personnel with him moved past her toward the hatch to fetch her luggage and Jen&#x2019;s&#x2014;ï¿½just one regular case each, and their survival suits, packed by her own trusted crew. That last had necessitated a brief tussle with someone on the Spaceforce end, who had only grudgingly agreed that she could bring it if she wanted. The Commandant&#x2019;s aide, she saw, had turned slightly aside, clearly listening to something in his earbug.<br><br>&#x201c;This is my aide, Commander Bentik,&#x201d; Ky said. &#x201c;She is from Cascadia, in the Moscoe Confederation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Glad to meet you, Commander,&#x201d; the Commandant said. &#x201c;Forgive me that I am not fully acquainted with Cascadian protocol.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is my honor, sir,&#x201d; Bentik said. &#x201c;I assure you I will not take offense. Cascadian protocol is not an issue here; I must hope that I have mastered that of Slotter Key.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let there be no strain between us,&#x201d; the Commandant said, the proper Cascadian mode for senior to junior, and turned to Ky. &#x201c;As the shuttle is ready, Admiral, we might defer further courtesies to the shuttle lounge, if that suits you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Rector asked me to tell you that her new arm is in good shape, but she had a minor accident two days ago&#x2014;ï¿½nothing to worry about, she insists. Her physicians recommended she not come up, or she would have met you herself.&#x201d;<br><br>Ky&#x2019;s wariness went up a notch&#x2014;ï¿½accident? Or attack?&#x2014;ï¿½but she kept her face and voice smooth. &#x201c;I was wondering about her arm. We don&#x2019;t comment on her age, but a complete biograft&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could be a difficulty, but has not been for her.&#x201d; The Commandant&#x2019;s aide, head still cocked a little in the manner of someone receiving more information, led the way down the ramp to the arrival lounge, and the six-ï¿½person security squad closed around them. The media presence melted away as they left the lounge for the first station corridor.</p><h2>Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art</h2><p>This absorbing biography of Fairfield Porter makes clear John Ashbery`s assessment of Porter as &#34;perhaps the major American artist of this century.&#34; Justin Spring tells of Porter`s troubled, bohemian life, his struggle to raise a family while dealing with a bisexual identity, his work as an artist producing realist works in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement, and his late triumph as a painter and critic.</p><p>Fairfield Porter, the lyrical American painter of tense slices of family life, was an extraordinarily complex and conflicted person. Born in 1917, Porter finally achieved a measure of fame in the 1950s as part of the second wave of New York School artists--only to be eclipsed as a realist painter a few years later by the brashly ironic crew of pop artists.<p> Born into a patrician family, Porter lived most of his life on a dwindling trust fund, in a succession of sparsely furnished rural houses that he kept escaping to hang out with artists and writers in New York City. (He also wrote poetry and art criticism.) Although his political sympathies led him to dream of being a great muralist, his discovery of the intimate domestic scenes of ï¿½douard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard proved the key to his mature style.</p><p> Porter's immediate family populate many of his best paintings, yet he was the most ambivalent of family men. He had five children with his long-suffering wife, Anne, a poet who survives him, but skipped town when each one was born. To complicate things further, he discovered in midlife that he was in love with the poet James Schuyler, who became a perpetual houseguest long after the brief affair was over.</p><p> <i>Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art</i>, by Justin Spring, is not the sort of art book you plop on the coffee table to browse "some day."

By the time it ended in 1815, Washington, D.C., had been burned to the ground, the national debt had nearly tripled, and territorial gains were negligible. Yet the war gained so much popular support that it ushered in what is known as the "era of good feelings," a period of relative partisan harmony and strengthened national identity. Historian Nicole Eustace's cultural history of the war tells the story of how an expensive, unproductive campaign won over a young nation&#x2014;largely by appealing to the heart.</p><p><i>1812</i> looks at the way each major event of the war became an opportunity to capture the American imagination: from the first attempt at invading Canada, intended as the grand opening of the war; to the battle of Lake Erie, where Oliver Perry hoisted the flag famously inscribed with "Don't Give Up the Ship"; to the burning of the Capitol by the British. Presidential speeches and political cartoons, tavern songs and treatises appealed to the emotions, painting war as an adventure that could expand the land and improve opportunities for American families. The general population, mostly shielded from the worst elements of the war, could imagine themselves participants in a great national movement without much sacrifice. Bolstered with compelling images of heroic fighting men and the loyal women who bore children for the nation, war supporters played on romantic notions of familial love to espouse population expansion and territorial aggression while maintaining limitations on citizenship. <i>1812</i> demonstrates the significance of this conflict in American history: the war that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner" laid the groundwork for a patriotism that still reverberates today.</p></p><p>Nicole Eustace is Associate Professor of History at New York University and author of Passion Is the Gale: Emotion, Power, and the Coming of the American Revolution.<p>Preface: Emotion, Persuasion, and the Meaning of War</p><p>When John Blake White's younger brother James announced that he planned to enlist in the U.S. Army in the spring of 1814, the elder White reacted with dismay. To his journal, he confided his "grief and mortification" at the news of his brother's plan. It was not that John opposed the war in progress, the British-American dispute now known as the War of 1812. A successful South Carolina lawyer and small-time slaveholder, John was also a patriotic amateur playwright and painter with a flair for taking on artistic projects with nationalist themes. Back when war had first been declared in June 1812, John had exclaimed that the news of the declaration, "though Melancholy," had "nevertheless inspired the heart of every American with animation and delight." Yet, despite the emotional pleasure he claimed to take in the war, when it came to the possibility of seeing his younger brother take on a combat role, he "remonstrated with him" and did "all in [his] power to demonstrate the impropriety of doing so." The idea of war filled John with agreeable feelings of "delight." Current events moved him to many creative flights of fancy. But he remained appalled at the thought that his brother wanted to take an active part in the fighting</p><p>A member of his local militia, John Blake White boasted the rank of captain and turned up to parade with his fellow militia members a couple of times a year. But he never performed any service more demanding than that and the war did nothing to interfere with the pleasant rounds of plays and parties that leavened his workaday world. White preferred to make his national contributions with pen and paintbrush rather than with sword or musket. Throughout the war years, he produced theater pieces and history paintings. He recorded often in his diary his "endeavour[s] to amuse myself with my pencil," noting that his inspiration was "furnished by the barbarities of the enemy with whom we are at War." White likely would have been perfectly willing to see his brother follow his example and assume honorary status in the militia. What filled him with concern was the fact that his brother had decided to enter the regular army.</p><p>In the official census of 1810, the United States of America claimed a population of 7.2 million people. Of this number, more than half a million served in the war in some capacity. But the half-million figure is deceptive in that most of those men were militia members who served very brief terms, often contributed services that were more ceremonial than actual, and frequently refused to cross state lines to render assistance any place where it was actually needed. Only about 57,000 men served as regular enlisted soldiers during the war, and of these only 2,260 were killed. By contrast, the best estimates for the Civil War put total enlistments North and South at 2.5 million men out of a population of approximately 31.5 million. And of these soldiers, approximately 617,000 met their deaths. Proportionately, less than half of one percent of all servicemen died during the War of 1812, while a staggering one-fourth of all soldiers died in the Civil War. Statistics like these seem to argue against the historical significance of the War of 1812.</p><p>Yet the life of John Blake White suggests that the meaning of the War of 1812 can be found as much in books and broadsides as on battlefields. If we truly wish to assess the impact and importance of the War of 1812, we need to consider it as a cultural event as much as a military one. Like John Blake White, many more people in the United States read and wrote about the War of 1812 than fought in it.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The War of 1812 enjoys the uneasy distinction of being the first war ever to be declared in a modern democracy. Unlike the American Revolution, which developed piecemeal out of the patriot protest movement, and unlike the many quasi wars and campaigns conducted in the first quarter century or so of the new nation's history, the War of 1812 was begun by formal constitutional process. James Madison made a detailed case against Great Britain in a June 1 message to members of Congress. They duly responded with a formal statement of hostilities, a bill that Madison quickly signed into law on June 18, 1812. Enormously controversial with members of the Federalist Party from the moment it began, the war received a sort of popular referendum in the next two presidential elections, of 1812 and 1816. Madison easily won reelection in November 1812 and his hand-picked successor and former secretary of war, James Monroe, enjoyed landslide success four years later, in 1816. Hundreds of thousands of men cast Democratic-Republican votes in these contests. The war, in other words, proved to be a popular success.</p><p>In strict military and diplomatic terms, the War of 1812 accomplished almost nothing at all. The declared foe was Great Britain and the desired object was Canada. Among a host of complaints against the British, the United States charged that nation with violating its international shipping rights and with impressing its sailors into forced service in the Royal Navy. By the war's end in 1815, after the British had burned Washington, D.C., to the ground and the national debt had nearly tripled, from $45 million to $127 million, all that the United States had managed was to convince the British to return all territorial boundaries and diplomatic disputes to their prewar status. Yet somehow, the population at large regarded the war as a rousing triumph.</p><p>In a democracy, public opinion matters more than anything else. Politicians gain and maintain power with the approval of the populace. The War of 1812 provided an ideal moment for Americans, from virtual unknowns such as John Blake White to leading national statesmen, to experiment with shaping popular public opinion. How could a war that might easily have been dismissed as a terrific waste of time and money, if not deplored as a disastrous display of hubris, instead have sparked what one newspaper famously described as an "era of good feelings"? Feeling, it turned out, was everything. And good feelings were not hard to generate when most people did not experience the war firsthand, but only through their imaginations, as sparked by words and images on the printed page.</p><p>When President James Madison addressed the nation to announce that war had been declared, he said: "I . . . exhort all the good people of the United States, as they love their country, as they value the precious heritage derived from the virtue and valor of their fathers; as they feel wrongs . . . that they exert themselves." Immediately printed in pamphlet form in Washington and widely circulated in newspapers, Madison's call made clear the expectation that showing love of country required supporting the war. Emotion was required for morality; feeling would motivate the actions and exertions of "good people."</p><p>Both those who welcomed the coming of war and those who opposed it believed that marshaling the support of the U.S. population required mounting emotional appeals that would stir the soul. In 1812, Daniel Webster, an anti-war Federalist whose vocal opposition to the war would soon land him a seat in Congress, was an up-and-coming young lawyer with a flair for oratory. Rousing an audience of war opponents in the Federalist preserve of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on July 4, 1812, just weeks after the president's statement, Webster proclaimed that James Madison's war went against the traditions of George Washington. He knew this, he declared, because of the way the war made him feel.</p><p>"There is," Daniel Webster asserted, "not only a transmission of ideas and of knowledge, from generation to generation; there is also a traditional communication of sentiments and feelings." For Webster, it seemed obvious that anyone who was truly sentient would recoil from the prospect of an unnecessary war. Casting an eye toward "the horrible pit of European suffering and calamity," created by the Franco-British conflict in Europe, he urged his audience to share his vision. Reason alone might not be enough to sway the undecided. But emotional persuasion offered another way out. "If they will not hearken to the <i>warning voice</i>," he urged, "they may perhaps be shocked into some feeling by the evidence of their own senses." Webster believed that if only people felt the horror of war vividly, they would also oppose it avidly.</p><p>But the shock of feeling could easily cut the other way. War boosters well understood this and traded on emotion in their turn. Few people would witness the war with "their own senses," whereas many more would enjoy the pleasurable sensory experience of artistic and literary representations of war. Although war critics offered their audiences the discomfort of pain and fear, supporters presented far more enticing emotional options. When John Blake White created a "National Picture" featuring an Indian massacre and presented it for public viewing in his hometown of Charleston in August 1813, the local newspaper the <i>City Gazette</i> pronounced that, "the subject, though horrible beyond measure, is rich and glowing." White described in his journal the effect such paintings had on himself as artist and on his audience as viewers by explaining, "while it fully occupies the mind and exercises the imagination, of the artist, painting affords pleasure to the beholder, by elevating and enlarging the mind." In White's telling, even the worst moments of the war could produce an appealing sort of emotional frisson in the casual observers who visited the free exhibition of his art at the Charleston courthouse and commercial exchange.</p><p>The task White and other war boosters set for themselves was nothing less than the transformation of Webster's "horrible pit of suffering and calamity" into "rich and glowing" pleasure. To recast suffering as elevation and calamity as mental enlargement required performing a kind of emotional alchemy. Yet through just such "exercises [of] the imagination," many U.S. residents in 1812 came to view the war as a positive good.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Ostensibly a conflict with Britain over naval rights, the American War of 1812 quickly became a test of the strength and meaning of American patriotism in a nation torn by sectional and political factionalism. While Federalist war opponents based in New England often attempted to elicit feelings of disgust about the conflict, Democratic-Republican advocates concentrated in the South and West more often tried to evoke delight. Throughout the war years, Republicans worked to portray the war as a romantic adventure, one in which dashing young men went to war to win the hearts of patriotic maidens and in which the thrill of romantic love contributed directly to the surge of patriotism. From generic songs and poems to specific descriptions of particular military engagements, war supporters relied on a new language of romantic patriotism to tell the story of the war. From the desks of high military officers and prominent politicians, the presses of the nation's burgeoning newspaper and pamphlet printers, and the kitchen tables of ordinary scribblers came a flood of professional and amateur efforts.</p><p>While Federalists relied largely on feelings of fear and revulsion in their efforts to dissuade people from supporting the war, Democratic-Republicans saved their attempts to provoke disgust for descriptions of the enemy, including the British and their Indian allies. The Federalists failed to make a persuasive case against the war and one clear consequence of this was the way they faded forever from national power with the close of the conflict. Republican writers had all too successfully discovered the effectiveness of making war support the measure of love of country, and of likening love of country to ordinary romantic affections.</p><p>In American popular culture, in the era of the War of 1812, war stories and love stories intertwined. Many claims of equivalence were open and unrepentant. One of the first novels to come out of the war was an 1816 production by a New York writer named Samuel Woodworth with the unwieldy but suggestive title: <i>The Champions of Freedom; or, The Mysterious Chief, a Romance of the Nineteenth Century, Founded in the Events of the War Between the United States and Great Britain, Which Terminated in March 1815</i>. The book interwove seduction plots worthy of a sentimental romance novel with detailed historical descriptions of all the major events of the war. As a chapter titled "Love and Patriotism" made clear, the novel juxtaposed these seemingly unrelated story lines the better to showcase the essential relationship between romantic love and martial action. The chapter began with an epigram: "Love rais'd his noble thoughts to brave achievements / For love's the steel that strikes upon the flint . . . / And spreads the sparkles round to warm the world." Here love and bravery both appeared as inflammatory states, libidinal heat the spur of military honor. Americans of the early republic largely enjoyed the notion of romantic love as national duty.</p><p>Meanwhile, Woodworth's complex title elided the difference between the stated opponent of the United States&#x2014;Britain&#x2014; and the war's ghostly proxy losers, the "mysterious" Indians whose lands were overrun by the "champions of freedom." As war supporters well knew, the connections between war and romance were literal as well as figurative. Every time war boosters joined the prosecution of the war to the private love of courting couples, they made the takeover of Indian lands into a romantic possibility and a patriotic duty. Though the United States won no changes in British policy as a result of the war, the country did gain undisputed control of substantial Western territories once claimed by Indians, lands that would soon be settled by whites and cultivated in substantial part by enslaved men and women. In an age when starting a family usually meant clearing a farm, the population's fertility and the land's fecundity were closely linked. Yet in Woodworth's telling, as in the accounts of many self-appointed polemicists of the day, a war fraught with moral, political, and practical problems could be successfully portrayed both as a righteous cause <i>and</i> as a pleasurable romantic romp.</p><p>* * *</p><p>When it came to shaping public opinion, John Blake White, Samuel Woodworth, and thousands of other Democratic-Republicans quickly discovered how strongly emotions influenced judgments. By attaching delightful feelings to dire events, they could transform both how people felt about the war <i>and</i> how they thought about it. Blood and anguish held little appeal, but love and sex were hard to resist. Death and destruction stood little chance of support, but family formation and procreation spoke to universal aspirations. If the experience of the latter could be made to stand in for the former, then liberty and equality could emerge from slavery and territorial aggression.</p><p>Today, neuropsychologists can use sophisticated imaging techniques to study the way specific regions of the brain process stimuli.

One was the cranky Old Man in the Corner, an early &#x201c;armchair&#x201d; sleuth. The other isn&#x2019;t at all sedentary (and is a lot more likable) &#x2014; Lady Molly of Scotland Yard. Feisty, brilliant, and beautiful; precursor of the lay sleuth who relies on brains rather than brawn, Lady Molly, and her faithful sidekick and admiring chronicler Mary, began appearing in Orczy&#x2019;s entertaining stories years before the ï¿½rst Englishwoman did in fact become an ofï¿½cer of the law. These twelve clever, agreeably unportentous adventures of &#x201c;my lady&#x201d; were unknown to us before acclaimed novelist Alice Thomas Ellis brought them to our attention, and we&#x2019;re most delighted she did.</i></p><p>Introduction by Alice Thomas EllisBaroness Orczy was born in Hungary in 1865, the daughter of Baron Felix Orczy, a landed aristocrat and well-known composer and conductor. She moved with her parents from Budapest to Brussels and then Paris, where she was educated. Orczy also studied art in London and exhibited work at the Royal Academy. Later she married Montagu Barstow and together they worked as illustrators and jointly published an edition of Hungarian folk tales. Fame came in 1905 with the publication of &#39;The Scarlet Pimpernel&#39;, which was originally a play co-written with her husband. Its background of revolution in France and a swashbuckling hero, &#39;Sir Percy Blakeney&#39;, was to prove immensely popular. Sequels followed and many years later film and TV versions are enduringly popular, with new productions from time to time. However, Orczy also also wrote detective stories which have a keen following today amongst followers of the genre. She died in 1947.</p><h2>Stunned by Grief: Remapping Your Life When Loss Changes Everything</h2><p><p>A highly focused, conversational book that cuts through the clutter and zeroes in on flashpoint issues critical to a griever&#x2019;s healing, the approach to grief presented here is revealing, practical, and down-to-earth.

It shows how specialist planemakers evolved from general woodworking tradesmen in the early 1700 s and it traces the development of the wooden plane up to the author s lifetime. The history of the plane is told from several points of view: the lives of the makers; the uses fro which different planes were designed; the changing shape of planes (length, profile, wedge, chamfers); makers marks and those of owners (often of successive generations) all indicating pride in craftsmanship and ownership of an expensive possession.</p><p>W.

After introductory sections, including a glossary, an explanation of materials and tips for outdoor painting, a discussion of value scales, and details of basic watercolor techniques, the author, whose works include two other watercolor-basics titles, uses step-by-step demonstrations of how to paint water, trees, mountains and hills, skies, buildings, and textures. Each section's presentation begins with a materials list and reference photo (enabling painters to make the most of rainy days), then proceeds with full-color steps culminating in a finished picture. A tidal pool study illustrates reflectivity, an Alaskan ice floe is used to demonstrate techniques for surface patterns, and an image of trees demonstrates the strengths of key tree shapes.

Tour.</p><p>For centuries, links between biology and behavior have been mined for ammunition in the gender wars. Western science has often tainted the discussion by skewing the norm toward men so that the biological underpinnings of their weaknesses and strengths are applauded while those of women are denigrated. <i>Sex on the Brain</i> is a chatty, fairly evenhanded report on a broad range of animal and human studies intended to provide insight into hot-button issues such as aggression, nurturing behavior, infidelity, homosexuality, hormonal drives, and sexual signals. According to one researcher, "We inherit the behavior essentially of our past." Morning sickness, for example, which steers some women away from strong tastes and smells, may once have protected babes in utero from toxic items. Infidelity is a way for men to ensure genetic immortality. Interestingly, when we deliberately change sex-role behavior--say men become more nurturing or women more aggressive--our hormones and even our brains respond by changing, too.Pulitzer Prize winner Deborah Blum is a professor of science journalism at the University of Wisconsin.

This enduring poem, which begins with the now-classic line "'Twas the night before Christmas," paints a vivid picture of St. Nick and his miniature sleigh pulled by eight tiny reindeer.

It is only one event in the long and complicated history of race relations in Marion, a history much ignored and considered by many to be best forgotten. But the lynching cannot be forgotten. It is too much a part of the fabric of Marion, too much ingrained even now in the minds of those who live there. In<i> Our Town</i> journalist Cynthia Carr explores the issues of race, loyalty, and memory in America through the lens of a specific hate crime that occurred in Marion but could have happened anywhere.<br><br>Marion is our town, America&#x2019;s town, and its legacy is our legacy.<br><br>Like everyone in Marion, Carr knew the basic details of the lynching even as a child: three black men were arrested for attempted murder and rape, and two of them were hanged in the courthouse square, a fate the third miraculously escaped. Meeting James Cameron&#x2013;the man who&#x2019;d survived&#x2013;led her to examine how the quiet Midwestern town she loved could harbor such dark secrets. Spurred by the realization that, like her, millions of white Americans are intimately connected to this hidden history, Carr began an investigation into the events of that night, racism in Marion, the presence of the Ku Klux Klan&#x2013;past and present&#x2013;in Indiana, and her own grandfather&#x2019;s involvement. She uncovered a pattern of white guilt and indifference, of black anger and fear that are the hallmark of race relations across the country. <br><br>In a sweeping narrative that takes her from the angry energy of a white supremacist rally to the peaceful fields of Weaver&#x2013;once an all-black settlement neighboring Marion&#x2013;in search of the good and the bad in the story of race in America, Carr returns to her roots to seek out the fascinating people and places that have shaped the town. Her intensely compelling account of the Marion lynching and of her own family&#x2019;s secrets offers a fresh examination of the complex legacy of whiteness in America. Part mystery, part history, part true crime saga, <i>Our Town</i> is a riveting read that lays bare a raw and little-chronicled facet of our national memory and provides a starting point toward reconciliation with the past.<br>On August 7, 1930, three black teenagers were dragged from their jail cells in Marion, Indiana, and beaten before a howling mob. Two of them were hanged; by fate the third escaped. A photo taken that night shows the bodies hanging from the tree but focuses on the faces in the crowd&#x2014;some enraged, some laughing, and some subdued, perhaps already feeling the first pangs of regret.<br><br>Sixty-three years later, journalist Cynthia Carr began searching the photo for her grandfather&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#34;For those many blacks who have despaired of ever living in an America that has faced and told the truth, Our Town is an unexpected balm. . . . Carr joins the likes of Edward Ball (Slaves in the Family) and Diane McWhorter (Carry Me Home) in helping lead America to the promised land of racial reconciliation.&#34; --Debra Dickerson, ElleCynthia Carr was for many years an arts writer for <i>The Village Voice</i>, writing as C.Carr.

Once there, he studied with several teachers and lived the austere life of a yogi, eventually falling under the loving blanket of Neem Karoli Baba, who renamed him Bhagavan Das, or "servant of God." For seven years Das moved through the subcontinent, from Bombay to Madras, Kashmir to Darjeeling, fully embracing Hinduism and all its practices, worshiping the Divine Mother, and studying Buddhism, transcendental meditation, and tantra.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nepal he met and became the teacher of Richard Alpert, the Harvard professor, LSD experimenter, and expatriate whom Neem Karoli Baba would rename Ram Dass.<br><br>After the publication of the bestselling classic <i>Be Here Now,</i> in which Alpert described their experiences together, Bhagavan Das arrived back in the United States to find he was a celebrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling on the guru circuit--where he forged a number of influential and lasting relationships with other seekers such as Allen Ginsberg, Alan Watts, and Chogyam Trungpa--Bhagavan Das lived more like a rock star than the saint he was proclaimed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke and sang in front of groups of thousands, had sex with spiritual groupies, did drugs, and witnessed the hypocrisy of his path and that of his peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;His disillusionment continued to grow; meanwhile, he felt an intense pressure to earn a more traditional living for his wife and children, and for years he struggled to integrate his Eastern mysticism with Western spirituality.&nbsp;&nbsp;In compelling detail, Das explores the myriad of forces that sent him on a tortuous journey that led him to study the peyote culture of the American Indians with Little Joe Gomez, fall under the influence of Joya, become a born-again Christian, follow Ammachi Ma, and eventually, after hitting rock bottom, find a way to reconcile both worlds.<br><br><i>It's Here Now (Are You?)</i> is the story of a spiritual awakening in the East, a fall from grace in the West, and a peaceful reconciliation with the sacred center.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a vivid memoir of one man's search for higher purpose amidst temptation and the pressures of contemporary life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the love story of the spiritual marriage between Bhagavan Das and his guru, Neem Karoli Baba.&nbsp;&nbsp;With his unique historical perspective, wisdom, and insight, Bhagavan Das sheds light on today's belief systems and how a new spirituality has developed in this country.&nbsp;&nbsp;A spiritual adventure like no other, <i>It's Here Now (Are You?)</i> will inspire seekers of any age on their own road to fulfillment.</p><p>Bhagavan Das is back. The 1970's guru of egregiousness, who inspired the title of Ram Dass' <i>Be Here Now</i>, has penned a spiritual memoir that is stranger than fiction, farther out than the Oort Cloud. We last saw our hero when he was a spiritual rock star touring the hippie circuit with Allen Ginsberg. Soon thereafter he dropped out of the scene and took a job at a Dodge dealership to support his second family. Peyote beckoned him to the desert, then he raised magic mushrooms, sold encyclopedias to Marines, dabbled in solar power, attended Bible college, and ended up selling overpriced car insurance to poor people--until his latest 18-year-old girlfriend flipped out on acid and ended his career.<p> Bhagavan Das's writing is guileless. He neither boasts nor apologizes. He describes the manic ride he has been on since he left California after high school. For seven years he wandered around India and Nepal, practicing austerities, sitting at the feet of gurus, studying Buddhist scriptures, and getting laid. The common denominator in his pursuits seems to be a search for the ultimate high. Whether he is kissed on the forehead by a saint, standing at the foot of a 20-foot stone statue of Vishnu, lost in meditation, dropping acid, or being initiated into tantric sex, his descriptions are in the same terms: "mind-blowing," "out-of-body," "ultimate bliss," "beyond the beyond." <i>It's Here Now (Are You?)</i> is an entertaining, vicarious journey through a life that you don't mind visiting, but you wouldn't want to live. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>AH, BHAGAVAN DAS SINGING<p>Bhagavan Das gets in and out of taxis with his giant body carrying a tiny baby<br>Bhagavan Das sits on floors to sing, closes his eyes, and groans to God for hours<br>Bhagavan Das says Tah Dah Nah into the microphone hole talking Gandarva loka babytalk<br>Bhagavan Das sings the blues in Yogic Sanskrit like a perfect Virgin<br>Bhagavan Das sat on the street with beggars in Allahabad and Almora weeping Raaaam! half a decade crying all alone<br>Bhagavan Das kisses the feet of his teachers and wanders around the planet like a big yellow-robed dope<br>If I thought I had nothing better to do I'd follow Bhagavan Das around the equator singing Bloop Bloop Bloop Bom Shankar till I had something better to do<br>Bhagavan Das never had anything better to do than call up Mystic Mama on the Mantric Telephone<br>Bhagavan Das does nothing better than sit on the ground and close his eyes and sing to his Guru<br>Bhagavan Das is my mother that's why I kiss Bhagavan Das' feet singing Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah!</p><p>--Allen Ginsberg</p><p></p></p><h2>Knight&#39;s Fee</h2><p>Out of sight of the patrolling sentinels, Randal sits on the gatehouse roof. The orphan is more at home with the hounds he tends, but he yearns to see the new Lord arrive at Arundel Castle. As he leans over the battlements to watch the procession, a fig slips from Randal&#39;s hand and lands right on the nose of Hugh Goch&#39;s horse. The accident is small, but it will change Randal&#39;s entire life. A game of chess, a brave minstrel, a kind old knight, and a friend will point Randal to squirehood, and his own courage will pave his path to become a knight. Battle between the sons of William the Conqueror makes Randal&#39;s journey in Norman England an exciting one, but intrigue and deceit may take from Randal a heavy knight&#39;s fee.</p><p>Rosemary Sutcliff&#39;s books have been published throughout the world.

But whether you want to shoot squirrels, punch holes in paper targets, or defend your home, there is only one path to achieving consistent accuracy with a handgun: mastering the fundamentals of marksmanship. Written by a former U.S. Marine Corps firearms instructor who has taught more than a thousand law enforcement, military, and security personnel, <b>The Perfect Pistol</b> Shot uses succinct lessons, uncommon exercises, and real-world stories to provide a fresh look at a vital topic for all gunmen. It includes:<ul><li>The single most important "trick" to perfecting handgun marksmanship</li><li>A simple concept for learning how to shoot a gun twice as fast</li><li>A series of unique "Prove It" exercises that allow you to test the concepts offered without the pressure of actual shooting</li><li>An entertaining chapter on guns, gun magazines, and gun gurus that will help you make wiser choices about your training</li></ul>Knowing how to engage targets is valuable for the defensive shooter, but if "engaging" doesn't translate into "hitting," what's the point? You must have a solid foundation on which to build tactical skills. Your reward will be conversion from just another hapless shooter into an independent marksman.</p><p><b>The Perfect Pistol Shot</b> is intended to bring students through a systematic process that ends with the ability to consistently self-coach and self-correct every shot, whether on the range or in the field. Intentional accuracy (marksmanship) is objective science that can be thoughtfully duplicated, not a subjective martial art. It does not matter whether your shooting has wild swings in accuracy or whether you have chronic bad habits, the material in this book has already been proven to produce dramatic results. Anyone in reasonable health with a safe, modern, sighted, full-sized handgun of centerfire caliber may expect no less than the following measureable standard when properly applying the material in this book:<br><br>7 yards: Three shots in one ragged hole.<br><br>25 yards: Three shots in less than a four inch circle.<br><br>100 yards: Consistent torso hits on a full-sized silhouette.<br><br>It was certainly not my intention to offer yet another "new and improved" method for shooting a handgun. Instead I am hoping to offer marksmanship knowledge based on more than two hundred years of experience gathered by the world's best practical marksmen, the United States Marines. The information has been interpreted for practical use by street-level law enforcement and modern sport shooters, and includes drills and exercises intended to convey a fundamental understanding of what it takes to hit your mark.<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>A.H.

A chapter on &#x201c;Ocean Life&#x201d; introduces readers to the vast wildlife living beneath the ocean surface. The second section presents five chapters, each devoted to a major ocean basin (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern). The final section is titled &#x201c;The Human Ocean&#x201d; and discusses new technologies, exploration, the impact of human actions on the oceans, and the future of the oceans. The chapter on ocean exploration presents information on techniques for both above-water and underwater observation as well as methods for study from air and space. The authors also discuss the critical importance of the health of the oceanic ecosystem to the rest of the world. More than 100 large, full-color maps, including five new maps that show details of the seafloor of the major ocean basins, accompany the text. Also included are more than 170 photographs and 36 illustrations, including satellite images, charts, and tables. The stunning illustrations come with detailed annotations that nicely complement the text. Three different kinds of margin elements are utilized: cross-references, seful Web links, and fact boxes, which summarize and clarify fundamental concepts. The volume concludes with a bibliography in addition to a subject index and a map place-name index. This would be a valuable reference tool for university, college, and high-school students and would also appeal to the casual browser. --Maren Ostergard</p><h2>Seasons</h2><p>The author shares his landscape and abstract photographs, reflects on his development as an artist, and examines influences on his work</p><p></p><h2>Silk Stocking Mats: Hooked Mats of the Grenfell Mission</h2><p>Beginning in 1928, the Grenfell Mission sent out a call to socialites: "When your stockings run, let them run to Labrador!"

Lulu is a grouchy blonde girl who begs her parents for a real dog. When they present her with a plush red toy poodle substitute named Harry instead, "Lulu went lulu.... She threw poor stuffed Harry onto the floor and kicked him and stamped her feet and banged the wall and slammed her door. Whew!" Unsurprisingly, Lulu's bedtime is soon interrupted by a "squeaky bark." The temperamental urchin peers over the foot of the bed to see an animate Harry, who is not at all happy about being mistreated. Furrowing his curly brow and dramatically pointing his paw skyward, the poodle threatens to leave Lulu for his alleged home country, France. At this, Lulu races to her closet, chooses a prim red coat and green beret worthy of Ludwig Bemelmans's Madeline, and accompanies her pet on a whirlwind trip to Paris, and by the time they return home, before dawn, they are the best of friends. Matje (When It Starts to Snow), a Parisian himself, gives readers a captivating bird's-eye view of the city's monuments and buildings, drawn on a vertiginous two-dimensional grid in a delicate, controlled ink line. His intimate scenes of caf?s, street corners and the algae-green Seine have powerful panache, and Lulu's attitude improves greatly in this sophisticated setting. Her transformation testifies to the magic of dogs and the City of Lights. Ages 4-7. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 2-An odd twist on the usual fantasy of a child who believes a toy is real. Lulu refuses to believe that Harry, the stuffed animal given to her instead of the pet she requests, is a real dog. Harry, for his part, is determined to prove himself. The tale has a happy ending when Harry saves Lulu's life and Lulu, in turn, saves Harry's. It is written in an arch, tongue-in-cheek style, full of strange inconsistencies (even for a fantasy). Harry and Lulu start out with an adversarial relationship; they snipe at one another verbally and, in disgust, Harry announces that he will return to France where he came from (even though he later confesses to being from Indiana). Lulu decides to accompany Harry even though she dislikes him, and they seem to walk to Paris over night. However, the watercolor-and-gouache cartoons do not show readers how this is accomplished. In Paris, Harry realizes that he loves Lulu and rescues her from the path of a speeding car, but the author gives readers little information to support this conversion. In addition, some spreads, like that of Lulu dressing for the trip to Paris, and the otherwise charming Parisian scenes, do little to advance the central story. Unlike Yorinks and Egielski's penultimate picture-book fantasy Hey, Al (Farrar, 1986), this effort lacks consistent internal logic and heart.<br><i>Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Greenwich, CT </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Miracles of Santo Fico</h2><p>A magical story of love...and miracles After twenty years, Leo Pizzola has come back to the Tuscan village of Santo Fico, still single and still looking for a way to get rich. The town is as poor as it was when Leo left, yet some things have changed. Of Leo&#39;s childhood companions, only little Guido, whom everyone calls &#34;Topo,&#34; embraces him. His best friend is long dead. The woman he once adored refuses to talk to him. And, worst of all, the kindly old town priest seems to have lost his faith. Perhaps what Santo Fico needs is a miracle-even if Leo and Topo have to manufacture one themselves. Now, as one botched scheme after another unravels, something completely unexpected happens, and wonders indeed begin to transform this Italian town, including the greatest miracle of all... Published around the world, this debut novel sparkles with the Italian spirit and emotions that will dance off the page and into your heart.</p><p>If you savored Joanne Harris's <i>Chocolat</i> or Frances Mayes's <i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i>, if you dream of honeymooning in San Gimignano or you've ever stood in a specialty foods store sighing over imported olive oil, you will fall hard for <i>The Miracles of Santo Fico</i>. By turns sentimental, romantic, and mischievous, D.L. Smith's debut novel is set in a small Italian hill town, like hundreds of others, that has been in decline for 60 years. Remote and dusty, with a dry fountain in its modest piazza, Santo Fico only attracts tourists when local boys change the road signs. But there is one hidden treasure in the grubby old church--a perfectly preserved fresco of St. Francis that looks strangely, miraculously like the work of Giotto--and when a black sheep named Leo Pizzolo tempts God by trying to profit from it, he must come up with a few miracles of his own to save the town. Expect picturesque charm, old wrongs made right, and a happy ending for all. <i>--Regina Marler</i>D. L.

Its author, Carl Dair (1912-1967) was one of Canada's best-known and most celebrated type compositors and designers. <br> <br> Discussing type as a design material as well as a means of communication, Dair argued that if type is understood in terms of design, the user of type will be better able to work with it to achieve maximum clarity and aesthetic pleasure. He guides the reader through a study of typography that starts with the examination of an individual letter and proceeds with words, lines, and masses of text. <br> <br> Dair details the main design elements of type - size, weight, structure, form, colour, direction, and texture - and illustrates the applications of typography in books, advertising, magazines, and other printed forms. The various schools of typography are discussed and the book includes over 150 examples of imaginative typography from around the world. <br> <br> Design with Type is a classic work in a field of design that continues to flourish. Dair's influence on subsequent typographers and designers of print media is considerable and deserving of further study.</p><p></p><h2>The Shape of the Liturgy</h2><p>The acquisition of the A &amp; C Black theology list brings major Biblical commentaries and some of contemporary theology's most distinguished scholars to Continuum's already outstanding list.

Her name is familiar to many who practice the art of interior design or who are linked to the fashionable world of tastemaking. She provided appropriate settings for the new rich in the first half of the 20th century and in the process helped to shape our understanding of what we have come to know as the modern domestic interior. I am going in now for interior decoration. By that I mean supplying objets d art and giving advice regarding the decoration of their houses to wealthy persons who do not have the time, inclination, nor culture to do such work for themselves. It is nothing new. Women have done the same thing before. (Elsie de Wolfe) Through the measured re-examination of known materials as well as the review of history-clarifying documents that have been overlooked or underused by previous de Wolfe enthusiasts, Elsie de Wolfe: The Birth of Modern Interior Decoration provides the foundation of a renewed interest in her groundbreaking career, her philosophy of design, and her belief that an atmosphere of beauty could cure a world of ills. This large format, profusely illustrated book covers 29 projects (including Villa Trianon, The Colony Club, Anne Vanderbilt, Anne Morgan, the Duchess of Windsor, and J. Ogden Armour, to name a few) and concludes with a timeline of her works. Written by English decorative arts scholar Penny Sparke and edited by New York Times contributor Mitchell Owens, Elsie de Wolfe: The Birth of Modern Interior Decoration presents the most in-depth look ever into the design aesthetic of this early 20th-century master decorator.</p><p>Elsie de Wolfe is a 20th-century legend and is the mother of modern interior decoration.

All around us the alarms are going off, warning of the danger of new, deadly diseases. And yet, as Nancy Tomes reminds us in her absorbing book, this is really nothing new. A remarkable work of medical and cultural history, <i>The Gospel of Germs</i> takes us back to the first great "germ panic" in American history, which peaked in the early 1900s, to explore the origins of our modern disease consciousness. </p><p> Little more than a hundred years ago, ordinary Americans had no idea that many deadly ailments were the work of microorganisms, let alone that their own behavior spread such diseases. <i>The Gospel of Germs</i> shows how the revolutionary findings of late nineteenth-century bacteriology made their way from the laboratory to the lavatory and kitchen, with public health reformers spreading the word and women taking up the battle on the domestic front. Drawing on a wealth of advice books, patent applications, advertisements, and oral histories, Tomes traces the new awareness of the microbe as it radiated outward from middle-class homes into the world of American business and crossed the lines of class, gender, ethnicity, and race. </p><p> Just as we take some of the weapons in this germ war for granted--fixtures as familiar as the white porcelain toilet, the window screen, the refrigerator, and the vacuum cleaner--so we rarely think of the drastic measures deployed against disease in the dangerous old days before antibiotics. But, as Tomes notes, many of the hygiene rules first popularized in those days remain the foundation of infectious disease control today. Her work offers a timely look into the history of our long-standing obsession with germs, its impact on twentieth-century culture and society, and its troubling new relevance to our own lives. </p></p><p>AIDS.

The striped caramelo rebozo is the most beautiful of all, and the one that makes its way, like the family history it has come to represent, into Lala&#x2019;s possession. The novel opens with the Reyes&#x2019; annual car trip&#x2013;a caravan overflowing with children, laughter, and quarrels&#x2013;from Chicago to &#x201c;the other side&#x201d;: Mexico City. It is there, each year, that Lala hears her family&#x2019;s stories, separating the truth from the &#x201c;healthy lies&#x201d; that have ricocheted from one generation to the next. We travel from the Mexico City that was the &#x201c;Paris of the New World&#x201d; to the music-filled streets of Chicago at the dawn of the Roaring Twenties&#x2013;and, finally, to Lala&#x2019;s own difficult adolescence in the not-quite-promised land of San Antonio, Texas.<br><br><b>Caramelo</b> is a romantic tale of homelands, sometimes real, sometimes imagined. Vivid, funny, intimate, historical, it is a brilliant work destined to become a classic: a major new novel from one of our country&#x2019;s most beloved storytellers.</p><p><i>Caramelo</i>, Sandra Cisneros's first novel since her celebrated <i>The House on Mango Street</i>, weaves a large yet intricate pattern, much like the decorative fringe on a rebozo, the traditional Mexican shawl. Through the eyes of young Celaya, or Lala, the Reyes family saga twists and turns over three generations of truths, half-truths, and outright lies. And, like Celaya's grandmother's prized <i>caramelo</i> (striped) rebozo, so is "the universe a cloth, and all humanity interwoven.... Pull one string and the whole thing comes undone." The Reyes clan, from Awful Grandmother Soledad and her favorite son Inocencio to Celaya, follow their destinies from Mexico City to the U.S. armed forces, jobs upholstering furniture, and to Chicago and San Antonio. Celaya gathers and retells, in over 80 chapters, the stories that reinforce her family's, and subsequently her own, identity as they travel between the U.S.-Mexican border and within the United States. Rich with sensory descriptions and animated conversations and peppered with Mexican cultural and historical details, this novel can hardly contain itself. Also an acclaimed poet, Cisneros writes fiercely and thoroughly, and her characters enter and exit the page with uncommon humanity. Although the book is long--over 400 pages plus a relevant U.S.-Mexico chronology--in many ways it's not long enough. The world of the 20th-century Mexican family, and of the Reyeses in particular, is as complicated, timeless, and satisfying as our own family stories. <i>--Emily Russin</i>&#x201c;A lavish, richly textured meditation on family and culture. &#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ilan Stavans, <i>The Nation<br><br></i>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s certainly much in this long-awaited &#x2018;big&#x2019; novel from San Antonio&#x2019;s Sandra Cisneros.

Guided by Lala&#x2019;s narration of her grandparents&#x2019; and parents&#x2019; histories, <i>Caramelo </i>engages in a kind of playfulness (&#x2018;Tell me a story, even if it's a lie&#x2019; is the quote that opens the book) that is utterly bewitching.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rebecca Ascher-Walsh, <i>Entertainment Weekly<br><br></i>&#x201c;With <b>Caramelo</b><i>,</i> her exuberant, overstuffed novel, Cisneros undertakes storytelling on a grand scale, detailing the struggles and joys of three generations of a family, evoking a subtle panorama of cultural shifts.

There are two main suspects: her closest neighbor and her ex-husband. Meanwhile, on a quiet suburban street a midnight shootout takes place between three cops and two teenage boys. Dead, one cop and one kid. Wounded, two cops. Escaped, one kid. Martin Beck and his partner Lenart Kollberg are called in to investigate. As Beck digs deeper into the murky waters of the young girl&#x2019;s murder, Kollberg scours the town for the teenager, and together they are forced to examine the changing face of crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MAJ SJOWALL and PER WAHLOO, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. Mr. Wahloo, who died in 1975 was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories and novels. Maj Sjowall is also a poet.<b>Chapter 1 <br></b><br>She reached the bus stop well ahead of the bus, which would not be along for half an hour yet. Thirty minutes of a person's life is not an especially long time. Besides, she was used to waiting and was always early. She thought about what she would make for dinner, and a little about what she looked like&#x2014;her usual idle thoughts. <br><br>By the time the bus came, she would no longer have any thoughts at all. She had only twenty-seven minutes left to live. <br><br>It was a pretty day, clear and gusty, with a touch of early autumn chill in the wind, but her hair was too well processed to be affected by the weather. <br><br>What did she look like? <br><br>Standing there by the side of the road this way, she might have been in her forties, a rather tall, sturdy woman with straight legs and broad hips and a little secret fat that she was very much afraid might show. She dressed mostly according to fashion, often at the expense of comfort, and on this blustery fall day she was wearing a bright green 1930s coat, nylon stockings, and thin brown patent leather boots with platform soles. She was carrying a small square handbag with a large brass clasp slung over her left shoulder. This too was brown, as were her suede gloves. Her blond hair had been well sprayed, and she was carefully made up. <br><br>She didn't notice him until he stopped. He leaned over and threw open the passenger door. <br><br>"Want a lift?" he said. <br><br>"Yes," she said, a little flurried. "Sure. I didn't think . . ."<br><br>"What didn't you think?"<br><br>"Well, I didn't expect to get a ride. I was going to take the bus."<br><br>"I knew you'd be here," he said. "And it's not out of my way, as it happens. Jump in, now, look alive." <br><br>Look alive. How many seconds did it take her to climb in and sit down beside the driver? Look alive. He drove fast, and they were quickly out of town. <br><br>She was sitting with her handbag in her lap, slightly tense, flustered perhaps, or at least somewhat surprised. Whether happily or unhappily it was impossible to say. She didn't know herself. <br><br>She looked at him from the side, but the man's attention seemed wholly concentrated on the driving. <br><br>He swung off the main road to the right, but then turned again almost immediately. The same procedure was repeated, and the road grew steadily worse. It was questionable whether it could be called a road any more or not. <br><br>"What are you going to do?" she said, with a frightened little giggle. <br><br>"You'll find out." <br><br>"Where?" <br><br>"Here," he said and braked to a stop. <br><br>Ahead of him he could see his own wheeltracks in the moss. They were not many hours old.<br><br>"Over there," he said with a nod. "Behind the woodpile. That's a good place." <br><br>"Are you kidding?" <br><br>"I never kid about things like that." <br><br>He seemed hurt or upset by the question. <br><br>"But my coat," she said. <br><br>"Leave it here." <br><br>"But . . ." <br><br>"There's a blanket."<br><br>He climbed out, walked around, and held the door for her.<br><br>She accepted his help and took off the coat. Folded it neatly and placed it on the seat beside her handbag. <br><br>"There." <br><br>He seemed calm and collected, but he didn't take her hand as he walked slowly toward the woodpile. She followed along behind. <br><br>It was warm and sunny behind the woodpile and sheltered from the wind. The air was filled with the buzzing of flies and the fresh smell of greenery. It was still almost summer, and this summer had been the warmest in the weather bureau's history. <br><br>It wasn't actually an ordinary woodpile but rather a stack of beech logs, cut in sections and piled about six feet high. <br><br>"Take off your blouse." <br><br>"Yes," she said shyly. <br><br>He waited patiently while she undid the buttons. <br><br>Then he helped her off with the blouse, gingerly, without touching her body.<br><br>She was left standing with the garment in one hand, not knowing what to do with it.<br><br>He took it from her and placed it carefully over the edge of the pile of logs. An earwig zigzagged across the fabric. <br><br>She stood before him in her skirt, her breasts heavy in the skin-colored bra, her eyes on the ground, her back against the even surface of sawed timber. <br><br>The moment had come to act, and he did so with such speed and suddenness that she never had time to grasp what was happening. Her reactions had never been especially quick. <br><br>He grabbed the waistband at her navel with both hands and ripped open her skirt and her pantyhose in a single violent motion. He was strong, and the fabric gave instantly, with a rasping snarl like the sound of old canvas being torn. The skirt fell to her calves, and he jerked her pantyhose and panties down to her knees, then pulled up the left cup of her bra so that her breast flopped down, loose and heavy. <br><br>Only then did she raise her head and look into his eyes. Eyes that were filled with disgust, loathing, and savage delight. <br><br>The idea of screaming never had time to take shape in her mind. For that matter, it would have been pointless. The place had been chosen with care. <br><br>He raised his arms straight out and up, closed his powerful suntanned fingers around her throat, and strangled her. <br><br>The back of her head was pressed against the pile of logs, and she thought: My hair. <br><br>That was her last thought. <br><br>He held his grip on her throat a little longer than necessary. <br><br>Then he let go with his right hand and, holding her body upright with his left, he struck her as hard as he could in the groin with his right fist. <br><br>She fell to the ground and lay among the musk madder and last year's leaves. She was essentially naked.<br><br>A rattling sound came from her throat. He knew this was normal and that she was already dead. <br><br>Death is never very pretty. In addition, she had never been pretty during her lifetime, not even when she was young. <br><br>Lying there in the forest undergrowth, she was, at best, pathetic. <br><br>He waited a minute or so until his breathing had returned to normal and his heart had stopped racing. <br><br>And then he was himself again, calm and rational. <br><br>Beyond the pile of logs was a dense windfall from the big autumn storm of 1968, and beyond that, a dense planting of spruce trees about the height of a man.<br><br>He lifted her under the arms and was disgusted by the feel of the sticky, damp stubble in her armpits against the palms of his hands. <br><br>It took some time to drag her through the almost impassable terrain of sprawling tree trunks and uptorn roots, but he saw no need to hurry. Several yards into the spruce thicket there was a marshy depression filled with muddy yellow water. He shoved her into it and tramped her limp body down into the ooze. But first he looked at her for a moment. She was still tanned from the sunny summer, but the skin on her left breast was pale and flecked with light-brown spots. As pale as death, one might say. &nbsp; <br><br>He walked back to get the green coat and wondered for a moment what he should do with her handbag. Then he took the blouse from the timber pile, wrapped it around the purse, and carried everything back to the muddy pool. The color of the coat was rather striking, so he fetched a suitable stick and pushed the coat, the blouse, and the handbag as deep as he could down into the mud. <br><br>He spent the next quarter of an hour collecting spruce branches and chunks of moss. He covered the pool so thoroughly that no casual passerby would ever notice the mud hole existed. <br><br>He studied the result for a few minutes and made several corrections before he was satisfied. <br><br>Then he shrugged his shoulders and went back to where he was parked. He took a clean cotton rag from the floor and cleaned off his rubber boots. When he was done, he threw the rag on the ground. It lay there wet and muddy and clearly visible, but it didn't matter. A cotton rag can be anywhere. It proves nothing and can't be linked to anything in particular. <br><br>Then he turned the car around and drove away. As he drove, it occurred to him that everything had gone well, and that she had got precisely what she deserved.</p><h2>Paper Son: A Lydia Chin/Bill Smith Novel (Lydia Chin/Bill Smith Mysteries)</h2><p><p><strong>The latest Lydia Chin/Bill Smith mystery takes the acclaimed detective duo into the Deep South to investigate a murder within the Chinese community.</strong></p> The Most Southern Place on Earth: that&#x2019;s what they call the Mississippi Delta.

S. J. was born and raised in the Bronx and now lives in lower Manhattan.&#x201c;Outstanding. Lydia and Bill were last seen in 2011's <em>Ghost Hero</em>, but Rozan's intricate plotting and affinity for characterization is seamless, making the reader remember how much we missed spending time with these private detectives. Rozan uses the historical footnote of Chinese grocers as a springboard for a rich, deeply satisfying mystery.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Oline Cogdill, <em>Associated Press</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A triumphant return of this sorely missed franchise.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stellar. As usual, Rozan is adept at devising a plausible but intricate mystery for her leads. She also presents a nuanced look at the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. Her superior prose and characterizations will make even newcomers hope for a shorter wait for the next book in the series.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rozan&#x2019;s detective stories have won every prize in the book, so expect mystery lovers to flock to this one.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Once again, S. J. Rozan proves why she is the consummate pro. Not only is <em>Paper Son</em> one hell of a detective book, the story also takes on a hidden gem of Southern culture&#x2015;Chinese history in the Mississippi Delta. Rozan continues to entertain with this wonderful series by taking us deep into the most unexpected and fascinating worlds. I have no doubt she&#x2019;s walked these Mississippi backroads.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ace Atkins, New York Times bestselling author of 'The Sinners' and 'Robert B.

Lydia Chin is taken out of her urban comfort zone in New York's Chinatown when her mother informs her that a distant cousin she's never even heard of has been accused of murder and needs help. The catch? Jefferson Tam is a Mississippi Delta native, a place completely alien to Lydia. Fortunately, Bill Smith, her occasional partner, was raised in the south and tags along to act as her translator and cultural guide. The two are soon entangled in complexities of race, family loyalties, and family history. S.J. Rozan writes with verve and humor while avoiding the usual cliches outsiders often succumb to. She even gets the dialect and speech patterns right!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Margaret Maron, awardwinning author of the Deborah Knott and Sigrid Harald mystery series</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rozan&#x2019;s remote Coahoma County is as atmospheric as her New York City, and the Chinese-American traditions of &#x2018;paper sons&#x2019; and their shop-keeping history in the South are craftily revealed in her trademark elegant prose. This new title in an award-winning and critically acclaimed series will be welcomed by fans. And what will they make of the big surprise in the final chapter?&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rozan skillfully weaves this history [of paper sons] into her narrative, adding texture and nuance to what is already a cracking good mystery.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>BookPage (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Blood and the blues are cooking down on the Delta in the triumphant return of Lydia Chin and Bill Smith.

The movie people haven&#x2019;t told me much.&#x201d; Maggie shrugged as she set down a platter of sushi on the long oak table at the back of her shop. Lucy and Dana, the first to arrive, sat in their usual places, sipping wine and gently coaxing yarn and needles from their knitting bags.<br> <br>&#x201c;The cast and crew arrive in town tomorrow,&#x201d; Maggie continued, &#x201c;and they&#x2019;ll be invading this place on Saturday, at the crack of dawn. The shop&#x2019;s busiest day of the week. What can you do? The show must go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where else are they filming? Is the shop the only spot in town?&#x201d; Lucy was almost done with her latest creation, Maggie noticed; an airy, oatmeal-colored, dropped-stitched scarf, perfect for the warmer weather. But now she seemed more interested in hearing about the movie than moving in for the kill on her project.<br> <br>&#x201c;Suzanne said they also rented a big house on the beach where they&#x2019;ll shoot other scenes. I think they&#x2019;ll be in town about a week. I know I should feel honored, but somehow I already regret agreeing to this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie was quietly proud of the Black Sheep Knitting Shop. She had found the perfect spot for her business years ago, the first floor of a beautifully renovated Victorian building that had once been a private home.<br> <br>But she wasn&#x2019;t surprised at all that the entire town of Plum Harbor had caught the eye of movie location scouts. A classic New England village on the Cape Ann coast, it was as picturesque a spot as any movie set, its tree-lined lanes filled with historic houses, and a row of well-kept shops along Main Street, which led down to a harbor and green.<br> <br>But now that reality was setting in, Maggie had serious doubts about whether she&#x2019;d made the right choice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Mag. You&#x2019;re our Hollywood connection. How will we talk our way into being extras if you come off like a big grump?&#x201d; Phoebe, Maggie&#x2019;s assistant, walked out from the storeroom, balancing a serving tray laden with other dinner necessities: a stack of flat sushi plates, little bowls for soy sauce, and a pile of chopsticks and napkins.<br> <br>Maggie enjoyed cooking dinner for a knitting night, but didn&#x2019;t have the spare time today. Sushi was a crowd-pleasing choice, and the chopsticks and knitting needles seemed somehow related.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think Suzanne is our official Hollywood connection, and I&#x2019;m not ready to give up my day job yet.&#x201d; Maggie began handing out the napkins and chopsticks to her hungry-looking guests.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll skip the audition, too,&#x201d; Dana added with a smile. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;d love to watch them film a scene or two, and see how the actors and director work. That would be interesting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy suddenly looked up from her knitting. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t mind going behind the scenes with the actors. Especially Heath O&#x2019;Hara.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy was a fan? Maggie had no idea. &#x201c;Sounds serious. Does Matt know he has such famous competition?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He drifts into a happy daze every time I mention Trina Hardwick is in the cast, so I&#x2019;d say we&#x2019;re even.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t seem his type at all. She&#x2019;s such a &#x2018;bad girl,&#x2019;?&#x201d; Maggie replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;All the more attractive as a fantasy,&#x201d; Dana noted. &#x201c;Like most celebrity crushes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very true. But that&#x2019;s just common sense,&#x201d; Maggie mumbled around a bite of spicy tuna. &#x201c;No offense.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dana shrugged, rarely offended by the group&#x2019;s gentle teasing about her profession. When advice from a calm, thoughtful voice was needed, Maggie knew Dana, their resident psychologist, was the first they turned to.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe that in like . . . less than two days, all those movie stars are going to be in this shop. Maybe even sitting in these chairs.&#x201d; Phoebe gazed down at her own chair in awe. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s totally freaking me out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hang in there, Phoebe. They&#x2019;re not here yet.&#x201d; Such a vivid imagination; Maggie admired that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry if you don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s really cool, Mag. But it totally is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And good publicity for the shop,&#x201d; Lucy reminded her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes . . . That&#x2019;s how Suzanne talked me into this. I&#x2019;m hardly the most starstruck person you&#x2019;ll ever meet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That we&#x2019;d all agree upon, for sure,&#x201d; Dana assured her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope Suzanne is coming. I saved her some sushi.&#x201d; Maggie glanced at her watch. &#x201c;She must know a little more. I&#x2019;m not sure if I should straighten up the place, or if they want that lived-in look. Will they be using the merchandise as props? Not that I mind, if they&#x2019;re careful with everything. I&#x2019;d just like to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stress. I&#x2019;m sure you can email someone who will answer your questions. The shop looks neat as a pin, as always,&#x201d; Lucy assured her.<br> <br>&#x201c;We try our best.&#x201d; Maggie glanced at Phoebe, who was suddenly staring at her food as if she expected the bits of fish to leap off her dish.<br> <br>Keeping the shop in order was one of Phoebe&#x2019;s main duties; making sure all the project books, needles, and other knitting necessaries were in their proper place and each skein of yarn in a cubby on the big wall, or tucked in a basket, carefully organized by color and fiber type. Phoebe kept up with this task most of the time. But she could so easily get distracted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who else is in the movie besides Heath O&#x2019;Hara and Trina?&#x201d; Phoebe asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jennifer Todd is the big star,&#x201d; Dana replied. &#x201c;I saw her once on Broadway, in Hamlet. She was amazing as Ophelia. She won all kinds of awards.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jennifer Todd is a better actress than Trina any day. Trina is mainly famous for being famous. And for her bad behavior,&#x201d; Lucy added.<br> <br>Maggie had to agree. After some early success in teen movies, Trina ran right off the rails&#x2014;if one believed half the news about her in gossip magazines&#x2014;trashing hotel rooms, causing scenes in exclusive restaurants. Arrests for shoplifting and driving under the influence. And all her dirty laundry, mug shots, and shocking outfits captured for the world to see on the covers of supermarket tabloids.<br> <br>Jennifer Todd&#x2019;s image would be found a few rungs higher on the magazine rack, gracing the cover of Ladies&#x2019; Home Journal or Vogue. Maybe sharing a favorite recipe or beauty tip in her interviews.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s face it, the media doesn&#x2019;t want stories about how happy and settled a movie star&#x2019;s life is. Scandal sells more magazines,&#x201d; Lucy observed.<br> <br>&#x201c;The film&#x2019;s director, Nick Pullman, has had one or two of those,&#x201d; Dana recalled. &#x201c;I remember years ago, he was involved in the death of a very young actress. I think she drowned in the pool at his mansion. A real tragedy. She was very young, not even twenty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s awful. I&#x2019;ve never heard that.&#x201d; Lucy put her knitting down. &#x201c;When was this? I don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh . . . about fifteen years ago. He got off without any big legal problems. I don&#x2019;t even think the girl&#x2019;s family sued him. But it was pretty messy, tarnished his reputation for a while.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Interesting.&#x201d; Maggie looked over her sushi, selecting a next bite. &#x201c;But some celebrities have a way of smoothing over rough patches that would derail mere mortals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They do,&#x201d; Lucy agreed. &#x201c;Maybe he paid the girl&#x2019;s family to keep it out of the courts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And not discuss it openly,&#x201d; Dana added. &#x201c;Reporters refer to the incident from time to time, but he&#x2019;s pretty much shaken it off and moved on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Few people are untouched by tragedies. Even if their lives seem golden from a distance,&#x201d; Maggie noted.<br> <br>&#x201c;How true, and Trina&#x2019;s had some tragedies in her life, too. Her father and older sister were killed in a car crash when she was only a teenager.&#x201d; Dana had set her plate aside and was already back to work, counting the pale yellow stitches along one needle, just about the color of her straight, chin-length hair. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no wonder she has so many issues now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trina is a walking cry for help,&#x201d; Phoebe agreed. &#x201c;But I heard she&#x2019;s been in rehab. This is her first big movie clean and sober.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . good luck to her,&#x201d; Maggie said sincerely. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful to see someone that young, with such great opportunities, throwing everything away.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dana nodded. &#x201c;I think Hollywood actors lead a hard life. So much pressure and temptation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jennifer Todd seems to be completely the opposite. So down to earth, the type of person you could talk to. Or even be friends with. I think she even knits.&#x201d; Lucy sounded as if Jennifer was already their friend, Maggie noticed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Dana agreed. &#x201c;Except for her chauffeur, housekeeper, chef, personal assistant, fitness trainer . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, not exactly like us. But you know what I mean. She&#x2019;s a real girl-next-door type. Though she&#x2019;s probably about forty?&#x201d; Lucy guessed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just read she&#x2019;s thirty-seven, and she is&#x2014;or was&#x2014;the girl next door. Didn&#x2019;t you know that she grew up around here?&#x201d; Maggie was surprised her friends didn&#x2019;t seem aware of that connection.<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard that somewhere, too.&#x201d; Dana looked up from her knitting. &#x201c;Is she from Plum Harbor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Newburyport,&#x201d; Maggie recalled. The village a few miles north was the last town on the Cape Ann coast and practically a metropolis compared to sleepy Plum Harbor.<br> <br>Lucy seemed cheered by the news. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ll hold a Welcome Home, Jennifer parade.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised. &#x2018;Any excuse for a parade&#x2019; is the motto around here,&#x201d; Maggie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;So . . . that means she graduated high school almost twenty years ago,&#x201d; Phoebe calculated aloud. &#x201c;Was she ever one of your students, Mag?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;I was at Plum Harbor High. Newburyport has its own secondary school.&#x201d;<br> <br>It seemed like another lifetime, her days as a high school art teacher. She had been teaching more than twenty years when her husband, Bill, had unexpectedly died. Maggie was paralyzed with grief at first, but eventually decided to pursue her &#x201c;someday dream&#x201d; and turn her love of knitting into a full-time career.<br> <br>A wise choice, she often reflected now, five years after she&#x2019;d opened the doors of the Black Sheep Knitting Shop. She&#x2019;d been devoted to teaching, but she loved owning her own business, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there are plenty of people around here who did know her well. Or will claim they did,&#x201d; Maggie added.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wonder how many Jennifer Todd will actually remember. Or if she keeps in touch with any friends she grew up with,&#x201d; Dana mused. &#x201c;I always think it&#x2019;s a sign of good character when people do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes . . . but her life must be so demanding compared to ours, I think we can cut her some slack,&#x201d; Lucy replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re all talking about me,&#x201d; Suzanne sang out from the front of the shop. &#x201c;Letting me off the hook for being so late and not even sending a text?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry . . . we still love you,&#x201d; Phoebe called back sweetly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maggie saved you some sushi. That says it all.&#x201d; Dana pushed a clean place setting over to an empty spot at the table.<br> <br>Maggie rose and headed for the storeroom, which doubled as a kitchen. &#x201c;Sit down and relax. I&#x2019;ll get it for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks. You&#x2019;re a pal.&#x201d; Suzanne dropped her big leather tote and landed in the seat with a sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Were you stuck with a client?&#x201d; Lucy asked.<br> <br>Suzanne worked in real-estate sales for a busy agency in town, Prestige Properties, somehow managing to fit her career around caring for her three children and her husband. Amazingly, she seemed to thrive on her demanding, fragmented schedule.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish. Clients are fun. Most of the time. I was stuck figuring out some mix-up with the extra insurance on the house the movie crew is renting. It&#x2019;s still not straightened out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were just talking about that,&#x201d; Maggie called from the next room. &#x201c;Do you know how long they&#x2019;ll need the shop? Will they do all their scenes in one day, or do they need to come back? There&#x2019;s really so much they haven&#x2019;t told me yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie knew she sounded anxious, but she couldn&#x2019;t help it. She emerged with Suzanne&#x2019;s dinner and set it down near her place.<br> <br>&#x201c;What service, thanks so much. All my favorites, too . . . yum.&#x201d; Suzanne surveyed her dinner, chopsticks poised to attack.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enjoy.&#x201d; Maggie took her seat, eager to hear more details.<br> <br>So were the rest of their friends, who all sat quietly now knitting and waiting for Suzanne&#x2019;s report.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had a few emails with the location manager today. As far as I can see, the schedule seems to change from day to day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie shrugged. &#x201c;I can go with the flow. As long as I have some idea which way I&#x2019;m flowing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the scoop. The cast and crew are flying into Boston and New York over the next few days. I think Jennifer Todd and Nick Pullman are staying at the Copley Plaza for a night. Everyone is due in Plum Harbor on Friday night and your shop is the first stop on their schedule. They say now they only plan on shooting here for one day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggie liked that news. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a relief.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But of course, that can change. If they don&#x2019;t get all their scenes done,&#x201d; Suzanne reminded her. &#x201c;I think the town will be insane. I&#x2019;m picturing a big caravan of trucks for equipment, and fancy trailers for the movie stars rolling in. I also heard they&#x2019;ve booked most of the Lord Charles Inn.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That makes sense. It&#x2019;s the only really nice place around here.&#x201d; Lucy frowned down at her knitting, counting stitches on the needle. She didn&#x2019;t look happy, but hadn&#x2019;t called out for rescue yet. Maggie gave her a moment to sort it out herself, knowing that built knitting confidence.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the name of the movie again?&#x201d; Dana asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Love Knots. I heard it&#x2019;s a thriller, but there&#x2019;s a romance in there, too. I&#x2019;m not really sure of the plot.&#x201d; Suzanne dipped another bite of sushi into some soy sauce.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s a website. Let&#x2019;s take a look.&#x201d; Lucy reached for Maggie&#x2019;s laptop, which sat on the table near her place. She slid it over and began typing.<br> <br>Lucy was a graphic designer who worked at home, and her computer was her best friend . . . next to her two dogs and her boyfriend, Matt. She did tend to search online for the answer to every question her life posed. Which was not always the best approach, Maggie sometimes reflected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see . . . no official website yet, but there&#x2019;s loads of publicity. &#x2018;Partners Off Screen and On: Jennifer Todd and Nick Pullman Team Up for Love Knots. How will this Hollywood couple handle the knotty mix of producing, directing, acting . . . and marriage?&#x2019;?&#x201d; She looked up from the computer. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even know they were married.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re the iconic LA power couple.&#x201d; Suzanne sounded positively offended by Lucy&#x2019;s ignorance. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;ve you been? Living on a desert island?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy laughed. &#x201c;Sorry . . . I fell behind with my celeb marriage scorecard. I&#x2019;m still stuck on Brad and Angelina.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What else does it say? Anything we should know?&#x201d; Maggie asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see . . . &#x2018;This romantic thriller is the couple&#x2019;s first collaboration in over ten years, though Nick Pullman has made three feature-length films with Todd&#x2019;s costar, Heath O&#x2019;Hara. Trina Hardwick also gets top billing in a supporting role.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess that means she doesn&#x2019;t get the guy?&#x201d; Suzanne speculated.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or she gets killed off.&#x201d; Maggie shrugged. &#x201c;They do say it&#x2019;s a thriller. Someone must get murdered. Or close to it. Don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy scanned the rest of the article. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t say much about the plot. A lot of effusive adjectives, though. &#x2018;The windswept shores and winding lanes of a coastal New England village provide the moody backdrop for this dark drama, centered around the owner of a knitting shop, played by Todd, who is tempted by the crosscurrents of a passionate love triangle.

He shows that the Church&#x2019;s and the Pope&#x2019;s complicity in the persecution of the Jews goes much deeper than has been previously understood. The Church&#x2019;s leaders were fully aware of the persecution. They did not speak out and urge resistance. Instead, they supported many aspects of it. Some clergy even took part in the mass murder.<br><br>But Goldhagen goes further. He develops a precise way to assess the Church and its clergy&#x2019;s culpability, which was more extensive and varied than has been supposed. He then devotes the largest part of the book to proposing a new and fuller understanding of restitution, including moral restitution, and shows that the Church has, even according to its own doctrine, an unacknowledged duty of repair. He explores this duty, analyzes the Church&#x2019;s tactics of evasion, and delineates all that the Church must do to redress the harm it inflicted on Jews and to heal itself.<br><br>Brilliantly researched and reasoned, A Moral Reckoning is a pathbreaking book of profound, and far-reaching, importance.</p><p>&#x201c;[<b>A Moral Reckoning</b><i>]</i> breaks important new ground. . . . Not a word is wasted in a book that can only be read with profit by all&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Spectator<br><br></i>&#x201c;An impressive bill of indictments. . . . The strength of Mr. Goldhagen&#x2019;s argument is that it makes strikingly clear the ways in which the Inquisition, the pogroms, and the Holocaust are links in the same dread historical chain.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Insisting that it is high time to &#x2018;call a spade a spade,&#x2019; [Goldhagen] has written a post-Holocaust moral reckoning with Christianity, and the Roman Catholic Church in particular, that pulls few punches and guarantees a hard-hitting bout over history, ethics and theology. Goldhagen&#x2019;s book is unlikely to leave its readers indifferent. Its significance, however, depends less on immediate reactions and more on what happens 10, 20 or even 100 years after its appearance. Goldhagen may be helping to create a new Christianity. It will take time to tell.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, born 1959, grew up in the Boston area. He attended Harvard University where he received a BA in social studies and a masters and doctorate in political science. He subsequently was a political science professor at Harvard for many years, teaching courses on a range of subjects, including European politics, democracy, and genocide. In 1996 he published <i>Hitler&#x2019;s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust</i>, which led to more prolonged and heated discussion around the world than just about any book in memory. It was an international bestseller that instantly turned Goldhagen into an international public figure, whose views are eagerly sought on both sides of the Atlantic. It won him many accolades, including Germany&#x2019;s Democracy Prize, given only every three years, for his singular contribution to German democracy. The <i>laudatio</i> at the prize ceremony was delivered by perhaps Europe&#x2019;s most esteemed and influential intellectual and philosopher, Jï¿½rgen Habermas.<br><br>Shortly afterwards, he decided to devote himself full-time to writing, and was in the midst of composing a book on genocide in our age (forthcoming with Knopf), when he produced an essay on the Catholic Church and the Holocaust for the <i>New Republic</i>, entitled, &#x201c;What Would Jesus Have Done?&#x201d; In writing it, he realized that some of the most crucial questions concerning the Holocaust and our public life more generally had been barely addressed, and certainly not answered properly, so he decided to temporarily put aside the book on genocide and write <i>A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and its unfulfilled Duty of Repair</i>. Hugely anticipated here and in Europe (the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote last spring, &#x201c;Those inclined to handicap this fall&#x2019;s publishing season already are giving long odds that the year&#x2019;s most contoversial nonfiction book will be historian Daniel Jonah Goldhagen&#x2019;s <i>A Moral Reckoning</i>.&#x201d;), it is a book that the Church and the public will not be able to ignore. It has already induced the leading Cardinal of the German Catholic Church and the Archbishop of Vienna to respond in interviews in their country&#x2019;s major magazines.</p><h2>A Modern Dry-Fly Code</h2><p><p>Merging a poetic reverence for the art of fly fishing with a wealth of practical information and technical advice, Vincent Marinaro's, <i>A Modern Dry-Fly Code</i> is the classic guide to dry-fly fishing. Originally written in 1950 as the sport was languishing for lack of innovation, this book helped bring about a fly-fishing renaissance on riverbanks across America. An ideal book for readers who share Marinaro's deep reverence for the fisherman's connection to the unspoiled natural world, <i>A Modern Dry-Fly Code</i> will have you yearning for the sound of running brook water, eager to try some of the author's legendary fly patterns, casting techniques, and scouting tips.</p> <p>The product of a lifetime of experience wading in the waters of the Letort, Big Spring, and other south Pennsylvania streams, <i>A Modern Dry-Fly Code</i> significantly changed the way American anglers think about dry-fly fishing. In addition to detailed information on matching hatches, trout behavior and biology, and where and when to cast which types of flies, Marinaro introduces several ideas of his own invention based on the results of his many experimental outings. Among the revolutionary ideas set forth in this book are Marinaro's 'minutiae', miniscule flies designed to imitate the dozens of tiny insects that swarm over the surface of the water as well as his thorax-style technique for crafting superb dry-flies.</p> <p>For beginners and expert fishermen alike, there is much wisdom to be gleaned from Marinaro's inventive and curious inquiry into the nature and practice of fly-fishing.</p></p><p>A Modern Dry-Fly Code has been described as "the best angling work of the last half century" and "the first original American contribution to fly fishing." It is a towering classic - intense, knowledgeable, and written with exacting care. Forty-seven years ago, when it was first published, it was far ahead of its time; today its insights into the behavior patterns of insects and feeding trout, its development of new and highly effective fly-fishing techniques, and its dramatic innovations in dry-fly dressing will remain valid and highly effective.Marinaro's reevaluation of the importance of terrestrial insects and his development of such patterns as the Jassid, the Ant, and the Pontoon Hopper expand the fly-fishing season far beyond the traditional period. His patterns, shown in full color, are widely acclaimed and used with striking success throughout the country. His valuable streamside studies remain models for anyone who would observe the most mysterious and intriguing of fish - the trout.Finally, A Modern Dry-Fly Code presents the first complete treatise on America's now-famous limestone waters, a generous ratio of practical lore and engaging reminiscence, and a profound rationale for the art of fly fishing.

They also discuss three genera of basal grasses that resemble bamboos. They describe the importance of bamboos to South American landscapes and cultures, explaining how jungles of <i>Guadua</i> and thickets of <i>Chusquea</i> host communities of small animals and how human societies use bamboo for housing, furniture, basketry, food, soil conservation, and musical instruments. Exploring the possibilities of cultivated bamboo, the authors also note its value in some regions as a timber resource.<br><br>Generously illustrated with color photographs and detailed line drawings, the book provides genus-by-genus descriptions of bamboos, as well as habitat data, range maps, lists of recognized species, and complete references. It also includes the most recent molecular and systematic evidence for bamboo evolution and phylogeny. The first ever to focus on the bamboos of the Americas, this volume is an essential resource for botanists, taxonomists, horticulturists, and gardeners.</p><p><b>Emmet J.

In life, his work was the inspiration for Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma, the most influential American Masonic book of its day, and in death, it proved to be a seminal influence on figures as diverse as Madame Blavatsky, A.E.

Included in this edition are the extensive and illuminating footnotes that were added to Lï¿½vi's text.</p><p>Some of these are by the anonymous translator, and some by the "Eminent Occultist" who seems to have been Madame Blavatsky herself.

Moore's book proves him not just a fantastic photographer but an excellent reporter and compelling storyteller. Such a vital part of the natural world, amphibians are lucky to have this artist on their side.<br> -- Jennifer S. Holland, <i>NYT</i> best-selling author of <i>Unlikely Friendships</i> and <i>Unlikely Loves</i>. Her latest book is <i>Unlikely Heroes</i>. </p> <p>A magnificent record of the global hunt for "lost" frog species. </p><p> Dr. Robin Moore has a passion for frogs and a fascination with finding new and "lost" species. In 2010, he spearheaded the worldwide "Search for Lost Frogs" campaign, which coordinated the efforts of 33 teams of scientists in 19 countries on five continents in a quest to find 100 species of amphibian not seen in over a decade. </p><p> <i>In Search of Lost Frogs</i> is a stunning record of Moore's journey and what he and his team did (or did not) find. The book is overflowing with exquisite close-up photographs by Moore that display the frogs' remarkable coloring and camouflage, and reveal their diminutive size -- many of the frogs are less than 5 cm long, if that. Moore's engaging text tells the story of the expedition, its highs and lows, discoveries and failures, and the campaign's ongoing work. </p><p> The book's first half covers what frogs do for the health of the planet, the slippery slope of extinction, what is being done to monitor frog populations and find lost species, the Lazarus project (which aims to "revive" lost species) and the author's career-long resolve to find the Mesopotamia Beaked Toad. </p><p> The second half of the book is about the searches. Moore describes the struggles, victories and dangers as well as the science.

We hiked across windswept peaks under cotton-wool clouds billowing in a sapphire sky--the air so thin that it made my head pound and my lungs ache--in search of a creature no bigger than my thumb. The frog had not been seen in two decades; its disappearance had been as sudden as it was mysterious. The frog was posthumously named after the Quechua word for sadness, to lament the loss of frogs from cool streams and glassy pools across South America and beyond. It was my first search for a lost frog, but just one step of a bigger journey. </p><p> The following year in the shallows downstream I saw my first corpse. She was also a harlequin frog, but a different kind--with brilliant yellow on black, she was as beautiful in death as in life. Her stillness was broken only by the rhythmic wash of water on splayed limbs, and onto her back clung a male--oblivious to her passing--trying to mate. They were among the last of a species new to science. As her rigid limbs were squeezed into a jar filled with frogs like pickled eggs back at the lab in Quito, she took her place in a growing queue of species to be named and mourned. Her companion would join her just weeks later; both of their lives taken by a silent killer that was on the move, from Costa Rica to Ecuador and Australia to California. </p><p> The slow tug of nostalgia for lost amphibians punctuated by jolts of grief at the sight of dead frogs transformed a childhood passion, nurtured in the peat bogs of the Scottish highlands, into a global quest to unravel one of the most compelling mysteries of our time: what was happening to the amphibians? </p><p> My quest led me in 2010 to spearhead an unprecedented coordinated and global search for frogs, salamanders and the lesser-known caecilians. Over six months more than a hundred biologists slashed through thick jungle, waded up rivers and hiked remote mountain passes, from Borneo to Brazil, Colombia to Congo and Israel to India, faced with long odds and often miserable conditions and armed with boots, headlamps and dogged determination to find some of the most elusive creatures on earth. I was lucky enough to join some of these searches, to feel the pangs of disappointment and the thrill of discovery in some of the most remote and uncharted corners of the world. </p><p> On the following pages I invite you to join me on my journey as it unfolds in three parts. It begins in the back gardens and remote moors of Scotland, where my search for elusive frogs and newts in garden ponds to misty peat bogs ignited a passion that fueled a quest to unravel the mystery of vanishing frogs from Central and North America to Australia; their disappearance sometimes so rapid that not even a corpse was left to mark their existence. In the second part of the story we embark on a journey with scientists around the world in search of frogs and other amphibians not seen in decades, before taking a step back to consider, in the final part, what the successes and the failures mean in the grander scheme of things. It is a story of rediscovery, reinvention and hope; a story about the fine line between life and death, and what it is telling us about the sixth mass extinction on earth. </p></p><h2>Moon-Node Astrology</h2><p>One of eight volumes in the Hubers&#39; well-known series of books on astrological psychology.

Booker has a science project for school: to take a daily bucket of water from the Vineyard Sound and submit a sample to an oceanographic DNA lab. From that, they can actually tell you what species of fish have been in those waters: striped bass, blues...and sharks! But Devlin comes up with something else in her bucket from the days when pirates hid treasures along New England coastline. With access to the crime DNA lab back in NYC (courtesy of her mother), Dev is going to solve the mystery of this treasure...and figure out all of the secrets Martha's Vineyard is hiding.</p><p><b>Linda Fairstein</b>&nbsp;was chief of the Sex Crimes Unit of the district attorney&#x2019;s office in Manhattan for more than two decades and is America&#x2019;s foremost legal expert on sexual assault and domestic violence.

Fairstein lives in Manhattan and on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard.<p><b>1</b></p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go into the ocean, Dev,&#x201d; Booker Dibble shouted to me. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t safe!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just wading in up to my ankles for now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the lifeguard isn&#x2019;t here yet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a strong riptide, you could get pulled right out to sea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three years on the Ditchley swim team,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I think I can hold my own in a couple of feet of water.&#x201d;</p><p>It was just after nine o&#x2019;clock on an already hot and humid August morning. Booker and I were on a stretch of beach called the Inkwell, in the town of Oak Bluffs on the island of Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re way past the ankles. Looks more like your knobby knees are sunk already,&#x201d; Booker said. &#x201c;Just back up and sit tight for a while. Make a sand castle. A huge one, maybe in the shape of the New York City Public Library.&#x201d;</p><p>Booker and I had solved our first caper at that great building. But I was ready to move on now. New adventures interested me more than looking back, and the key to our next caper was just ahead of me in the dark waters of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe later,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;The beach will get too crowded before very long. Now&#x2019;s your chance.&#x201d;</p><p>There had been a fierce thunderstorm the night before. The sand was churned up in the foamy water that was crashing around me and landing on the beach with more force than usual. I was trying to steady myself, stretching out both arms and balancing the large plastic bucket I was holding in my left hand.</p><p>&#x201c;I just need to scoop up my sample,&#x201d; I said, leaning over to run the pail from side to side in the rough surf to gather sixteen ounces of water&#x2014;and some of the sandy sea bottom&#x2014;for my fall science project.</p><p>Everyone in my class had the same summer assignment. We each had to gather a water sample from the sea or a freshwater lake, to prove whether fish left their DNA behind when they swam through the area.</p><p>&#x201c;I promise you the ocean is still going to be here when the lifeguard shows up. He&#x2019;s just running late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that. But part of the idea is that I&#x2019;m going to collect my sample at a specific time every day. Nine o&#x2019;clock. I don&#x2019;t want my first effort to be out of sync,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I have to be consistent. All good scientists have a firm methodology, don&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Scientists don&#x2019;t take foolish risks,&#x201d; Booker said.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Benjamin Franklin flew a kite when there was lightning right over his head. In fact, a kite with a silk string and a metal house key attached to it,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head at the mere thought. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how he proved that lightning causes an electric charge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like risky business,&#x201d; Booker said.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just worried because your grandmother doesn&#x2019;t want anything bad to happen to me while she&#x2019;s in charge of our Vineyard visit. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Zee?&#x201d;</p><p>Zee&#x2014;short for Ezekiel&#x2014;is Booker&#x2019;s eight-year-old cousin. He was sitting on a towel about ten feet from the shoreline, holding Booker&#x2019;s iPhone in his hands to keep it dry. He was busy playing with some game or app and just shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>I was so busy trying to show off my science skills to Booker&#x2014;one of my two best friends&#x2014;that when I swiveled my head to talk to him, I got knocked over by a gigantic wave. It rolled me around on the ocean floor, and I swallowed a mouthful of salt water as I came up for air.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s your sample for today, Dev,&#x201d; Booker said, laughing at me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got more H2O and seaweed in your stomach than you have in the bucket. Need a hand?&#x201d;</p><p>I stood upright, planted both feet firmly in the shifting sand, and turned my back on Booker and Zee.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me one more try,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You could stand right next to me and get your water for the day,&#x201d; Booker said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make more work for yourself than you need to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about the sand out here. It&#x2019;s been soaking forever, not like that dry stuff on the beach.&#x201d;</p><p>I was timing the sequence of the waves, sticking my right hand below the water&#x2019;s surface to stay still. Then I dragged the pail deep into the ocean floor and lifted it up, confident that I had collected not only a pint of water, but the muck below it. That stuff was home to snails and crabs and critters&#x2014;maybe prehistoric ones&#x2014;I hoped our science teacher had never seen.</p><p>I swiveled toward Booker and held up the pail in victory.</p><p>&#x201c;Doing experiments is awesome,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You were right about that. I feel like I&#x2019;m on the verge of some really big discovery.&#x201d;</p><p>I walked toward Booker, almost completely out of the surf, and rested the bucket on a flat piece of sand. Then I backed out again, raised my hands over my head like I was about to dive, and flipped into the water. I held my breath with my head underwater, plowing into the waves and away from the beach. When I had gone twelve or fourteen feet, I lifted my head and stood up&#x2014;neck deep&#x2014;then walked toward shore, shaking myself off as I emerged from the water.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to show off,&#x201d; Booker said.</p><p>&#x201c;I was covered in sand,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I had to do that to rinse it out of my bathing suit.&#x201d;</p><p>That was when I heard Zee call out a name. He was a quiet kid, and I was startled when I heard him yell.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; I asked him, cupping my hands around my mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Gertie!&#x201d; he yelled again.&nbsp;</p><p>Zee had stopped playing with Booker&#x2019;s phone and now had his eyes glued to a spot near the end of the pier where the ferry from the mainland docked.</p><p>I turned to look in that direction and saw something break the surface of the water. If Gertie was a swimmer in trouble&#x2014;with no lifeguard in sight&#x2014;I knew that I could help her.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Booker!&#x201d; I said, jumping into the waves and starting to freestyle my way into deeper water.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, it looked like Booker had followed me in for the rescue, but instead I felt him grab my right foot and tug me back toward the beach.</p><p>&#x201c;Get out of the water,&#x201d; he said, with a tight grip on my leg.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone needs to help that swimmer,&#x201d; I said, wriggling my body around to break free. But Booker dragged me back out until I sat on the sand like a beached whale.&nbsp;</p><p>People were getting out of their cars on the ferry line and snapping pictures of the scene below them, but no one was taking any action to make sure Gertie was okay.</p><p>&#x201c;Gertie doesn&#x2019;t need help, Dev,&#x201d; Booker said, huffing and puffing from his battle to pull me onshore. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a really strong swimmer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know her?&#x201d; I asked, puzzled by his reaction to the crisis I thought was unfolding in front of our very eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Not personally, but I know who she is,&#x201d; Booker said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a great white.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d; I said, looking from his face to Zee&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a great white shark,&#x201d; Booker said. &#x201c;Best to stay on the beach while she&#x2019;s in Vineyard waters.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Time of the Ghost</h2><p>There's been an accident!<br>Something's wrong!<p></p><p>She doesn't know who she is, and doesn't know why she's invisibly floating through the buildings and grounds of a half-remembered boarding school.

In Her Own Words...<p>"I decided to be a writer at the age of eight, but I did not receive any encouragement in this ambition until thirty years later. I think this ambition was fired-or perhaps exacerbated is a better word-by early marginal contacts with the Great, when we were evacuated to the English Lakes during the war. The house we were in had belonged to Ruskin's secretary and had also been the home of the children in the books of Arthur Ransome. One day, finding I had no paper to draw on, I stole from the attic a stack of exquisite flower-drawings, almost certainly by Ruskin himself, and proceeded to rub them out. I was punished for this. Soon after, we children offended Arthur Ransome by making a noise on the shore beside his houseboat. He complained. So likewise did Beatrix Potter, who lived nearby. It struck me then that the Great were remarkably touchy and unpleasant (even if, in Ruskin's case, it was posthumous), and I thought I would like to be the same, without the unpleasantness.</p><p>"I started writing children's books when we moved to a village in Essex where there were almost no books. The main activities there were hand-weaving, hand-making pottery, and singing madrigals, for none of which I had either taste or talent. So, in intervals between trying to haunt the church and sitting on roofs hoping to learn to fly, I wrote enormous epic adventure stories which I read to my sisters instead of the real books we did not have. This writing was stopped, though, when it was decided I must be coached to go to University. A local philosopher was engaged to teach me Greek and philosophy in exchange for a dollhouse (my family never did things normally), and I eventually got a place at Oxford.</p><p>"At this stage, despite attending lectures by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, I did not expect to be writing fantasy. But that was what I started to write when I was married and had children of my own. It was what they liked best. But small children do not allow you the use of your brain. They used to jump on my feet to stop me thinking. And I had not realized how much I needed to teach myself about writing. I took years to learn, and it was not until my youngest child began school that I was able to produce a book which a publisher did not send straight back.</p><p>"As soon as my books began to be published, they started coming true. Fantastic things that I thought I had made up keep happening to me. The most spectacular was<i> Drowned Ammet</i>. The first time I went on a boat after writing that book, an island grew up out of the sea and stranded us. This sort of thing, combined with the fact that I have a travel jinx, means that my life is never dull."</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is the author of many highly praised books for young readers, as well as three plays for children and a novel for adults. She lives in Bristol, England, with her husband, a professor of English at Bristol University. They have three sons.</p>Published in Great Britain in 1981 and available here for the first time, this gripping novel serves up often giddily hilarious fantasy that nonetheless deals unflinchingly with some ugly issues. At least twice in the course of the multi-layered narrative, the heroine has not the faintest idea who she is?a powerful metaphor for the novel's underlying theme of alienation from self. The story begins with the as-yet-nameless heroine floating?literally?through a boys' boarding school and its outlying grounds, a setting she finds oddly familiar. With a little spectral sleuthing (easy enough to accomplish when you're invisible) the disembodied spirit concludes that she is Sally Medford, one of a quartet of eccentric sisters who live at the school and are grossly neglected by their overworked schoolmaster parents. As the plot continues on its intriguingly convoluted path, evidence of time-travel begins to emerge: the college-age Sally is in a hospital, gravely injured after her abusive boyfriend throws her from a speeding car. Some part of her has journeyed back seven years into the past, where?with the help of her sisters and their schoolboy friends?she must undo a rash bargain with a powerful and ancient goddess. Given the violent boyfriend and the girls' ill-tempered father (prone to referring to his daughters as "bitches"), this tale is less overtly lighthearted than such Wynne Jones works as Howl's Moving Castle and Charmed Life but it is just as profoundly satisfying.

While we will spend the rest of the book exploring these nine personalities in detail--concentrating on how they appear and interact at work--let's quickly sketch them here.<br><br><b>One: The Perfectionist</b><br><br>The world seems perpetually out of order. Something has to be done, and done with step-by-step precision. Reports, for example, should be comprehensive but just the right length. The feedback you give should be concise, without wasting precious time and effort.<br>You live with a severe inner critic who monitors every thought, word, and deed. The critic tells you that there's always room for improvement, and your self-imposed standards keep rising.<br><br>You may not even know that you're angry until you hear the polite, clenched, and rising tone of your own voice saying, "Nothing is wrong and I never get angry."<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: Jobs that emphasize organizational structure and require meticulous attention to detail are attractive because quality control is embedded in your thinking. There's pleasure in good work and a job well done, so you drive yourself harder than most. Attention is drawn to improving procedures, correcting errors, and producing those small daily victories that occur when everything falls into place "just right."<br><br>Minimizing Risks: You're not attracted to jobs where decision making is based on fluid or partial information. The inner critic goes wild without guidelines, so you want to stop and check. On-the-spot decisions increase the risk of error and personal accountability. You may freeze in the crosscurrents of multiple points of view or differences of opinion.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "Perfection requires heroic efforts. I'm not there yet."<br><br><b>Two: The Giver</b><br><br>Your focus is on giving care and receiving close, personal feedback, so you find identity largely through relationships. A power behind the throne who manages by persuasion or manipulation, you generate approval by being pleasing and indispensable.<br>Several different "selves" develop, each adapted to meet the needs of others. You have a self for the boss, a self for the team, and other selves for family life. Your challenge is to recognize the difference between "giving to get" and altruistic support.<br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: Positioning is important. Your best selves emerge through association with front-runners who are counting on you. You work with a boss, not for the boss, because you're managing the boss's life. Attractive people in need of help are two bait.<br><br>Minimizing Risks: Environments that give little positive feedback are difficult for you. It's hard to keep going if you don't get some show of gratitude for having met other people's needs.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "They couldn't make it without me."<br><br><b>Three: The Performer</b><br><br>The world loves a winner, so you project a successful image, becoming the role model of your profession. You know you can make anything work if you throw enough energy at it.<br><br>Emotional life gets sacrificed along the way, but you decide, "Don't think about it--just do it." You're in control as long as you're fast forward, but inactivity is terrifying. Performers depend on immediate results and positive feedback, and it's horrifying to think, "What if this doesn't work?"<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: You want a status job where there's plenty of room for advancement and where you can excel. Work should reward long hours and star performance. People who don't want footprints on their back get out of your way.<br><br>Minimizing Risks: Jobs with a ceiling are unattractive. You like quick turnover and fast results, so creative projects requiring introspection and long periods of trial and error are grueling.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "You're only as good as your last victory. No cookies for losers."<br><br><b>Four: The Romantic</b><br><br>You may have two jobs, the one that pays the bills and your real job as an artist. You want work to create an avenue for meaningful expression, and you won't sell out for superficial prosperity.<br><br>Attention constantly shifts to the best of what's missing. What's far away and hard to get looks tantalizing, and in comparison, there's not much on your own side of the fence.<br><br>Your efficiency may be tied to mood. It's difficult to stay interested when you're feeling melancholy. Projects can languish during crises or when you're involved in a love affair.<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: You prefer a creative job that calls for a unique, even eccentric approach. You're drawn to emotionally charged occupations, running the gamut from working the trading desk at a wire house to handling the night shift on a suicide hot line. You keep asking yourself, "Why shouldn't professional life reflect authentic human values?"<br><br>Minimizing Risks: Mundane jobs in ordinary settings are crushing. Similarly, you need to avoid bureaucratic positions requiring anonymity and emotional detachment. Equally deadly are jobs where you have to work in cooperation with others who are more skilled, more valued, or better paid. You feel demeaned by plebeian work, the definition of which is known only to yourself. Gardening can be plebe work. So can being a CEO.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "Something's missing. I wish I had it."<br><br><b>Five: The Observer</b><br><br>From your detached point of view, a great many activities seem pointless. Why do people run around wasting energy on trivial pursuits when it's so delightful to retire and think? Since privacy is paramount, you treasure withdrawing to a protected place, safe from unwanted intrusion.<br><br>Doing with less simplifies everything. You have fewer needs to deal with, fewer obligations and office interactions. Doing with less also liberates more time and precious energy for study and thought.<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: Your ability to detach and analyze brings order out of chaos. Emotional detachment also makes it possible for you to work alone for long periods of time in single-minded pursuit of answers. You're attracted to the kind of jobs that protect your time and energy. When possible, you prefer limited windows of contact--and tend to reinforce your guard with a barricade of secretaries, E-mail, and fax machines.<br><br>Minimizing Risks: Any job that requires open competition or direct confrontation is anathema. It's risky to put yourself on the line when you have limited resources of energy. Open-ended meetings, spontaneous decisions, off-the-cuff brainstorming, and emotional interactions are draining.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "Mind over matter."<br><br><b>Six: The Loyal Skeptic</b><br><br>You act with strength under adversity but are prone to doubt when it's an easy win. Doubt, coupled with imagining the worst-case scenario, prompts you to ask, "What if this situation turns dangerous?" and "Yes, but shouldn't we think this through again?" Ironically, anxiety peaks with visible success because notoriety attracts competition. However, you go full out for an underdog cause or in a turnaround situation, particularly in collaboration with allies.<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: It's easy to work in hierarchical environments with clear lines of authority. You know what to expect and exactly what you're up against. Self-employed positions are also attractive, because you are your own authority. Your determination to deal with hard questions makes you a natural troubleshooter and a highly valued analyst.<br><br>Minimizing Risks: High-pressure jobs requiring spot decisions can lead to analysis paralysis. Under pressure, thinking replaces doing, sometimes producing procrastination. High-profile competitive jobs with ambiguous guidelines feel like a setup for failure.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "Question authority."<br><br><b>Seven: The Epicure</b><br><br>You see a world filled with opportunities and options, there's always new data to absorb and fascinating plans to make. Buoyed by a sense of your own worth, you feel entitled to success, and that enthusiasm rubs off on others. Where most people see limitations, you see positive new ideas.<br><br>Life's OK when you can see the possibilities. You're a brainstormer and networker who sidesteps conflict. This wizardry is both brilliant and distracting. It can produce original ideas, but also lets you slip away from sticky commitments.<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: When initial stages of a plan require multi-option thinking and a positive future vision, that's where you shine. You'll be attracted to new beginnings, and to the parts of a project that require synthesizing crosscurrents of new information.<br><br>Minimizing Risks: When implementing a plan requires routine work that does not support a spirit of adventure, you are less than interested. Critical supervision or closed-end jobs cause you to reframe the rules and network yourself into a better position.<br><br>Your Bottom Line: "You're OK. I'm OK. Isn't everyone?"<br><br><b>Eight: The Boss</b><br><br>The focus is on control. "Who has the power, and will they be fair?" You take charge and fend off the competition, rather than risk being controlled yourself.<br><br>Anger is the emotion of choice, and trust in others is built through confrontation. You know that people blurt their true thoughts when they're angry and during a confrontation you are trying to discover if people are manipulative, whether they fight fair, if they're honest, and whether they wimp out.<br><br>Speaking your mind clears the air, and tests coworkers to make sure it's safe to surrender control. Justice for all is a major theme, and you're highly protective of "our side," "my people," and "our team."<br><br>Maximizing Your Opportunities: You're known for your aggressive, take-charge leadership, b...</p><h2>The Original Adventures #1 (Hank the Cowdog)</h2><p>When he becomes the prime suspect in a murder that occurred on his ranch, Hank runs away to become an outlaw, but soon realizes that being an outlaw is dangerous work.

After completing his Greek education, he attended the American University in Cairo, Egypt, received his Th.B. degree from the National Bible Institute (now Shelton College) in New York, and his M.A. from New York University. In 1978 he earned his Doctor of Theology degree from Luther Rice Seminary of Jacksonville, Florida. He was also the recipient of several honorary doctorates.</p><p>In 1946, Dr. Zodhiates came to the United States at the invitation of the American Mission to the Greeks (AMG), Inc. At that time, there were two part-time employees working out of a one-room office in New York City. Initially serving as Secretary General, he became President of the organization in 1966 and served in this capacity until his retirement.. Now known as AMG (Advancing the Ministries of the Gospel) International, the ministry is involved in evangelistic and relief endeavors around the world. Ministry headquarters have been located in Chattanooga, Tennessee since 1978.</p><p>Throughout his six decades of leadership, Dr. Zodhiates demonstrated a profound commitment to the Word of God and a singular focus on accomplishing his calling faithfully. His style was marked by frugal stewardship, great enthusiasm, entrepreneurial courage and unexpected generosity.</p><p>Dr. Zodhiates is a recognized authority on the Greek New Testament. His works include an edition of the Modern Greek New Testament and the Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible. He authored numerous exegetical books and booklets in both the Greek and English languages, founded and published <i>Pulpit Helps</i> magazine, a monthly tabloid for ministers and Bible teachers, and taught for many years&nbsp;from the original Greek New Testament text&nbsp;on the <i>New Testament Light</i> radio and television programs.</p><p>Through Dr. Zodhiates&#x2019; prayer and effort, multitudes of children were cared for, many hundreds of national workers were trained and sponsored in the Gospel ministry, and countless new believers were introduced to the Good News of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Though his burden to bring the Gospel to the world remained undiminished, Dr. Zodhiates completed the transfer of leadership responsibilities to current AMG President Paul Jenks and had retired from active ministry by 2005.</p><p>After a long and fruitful ministry, Dr. Spiros Zodhiates entered into the presence of his Lord on October 10, 2009.</p></p><h2>Nicholas and the Gang</h2><p>Presents a collection of stories that focuses on the whimsical adventures and misadventures of little Nicolas and his friends, both in school and out.</p><p>Jean-Jacques Sempe (b.1932) is one of the world&#39;s most successful illustrators and cartoonists. He is the illustrator of the classic children&#39;s-book character, Nicholas, and author of a collection of some thirty albums of his cartoons and graphic novels, all published or to be published by Phaidon. His world-renowned illustrations and cartoons are featured on the cover of the New Yorker and in Paris Match. Rene Goscinny (1926 - 1977) is the world-famous writer and creator, along with Albert Uderzo, of the adventures of Asterix the Gaul. Born in Paris, Goscinny lived in Buenos Aires and New York before returning to France in the 1950s where he met Jean-Jacques Sempe. They collaborated on picture strips and then stories about Nicholas, the popular French schoolboy. An internationally successful children&#39;s author who also won awards for his animated cartoons, Goscinny died in 1977. Anthea Bellwas awarded the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the Helen and Kurt Wolff Prize (USA) in 2002 for her translation of W.G. Sebald&#39;s Austerlitz.

He stared down at the boy in the red zip-up jacket and shook his shaved head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bring that thing in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The fifty or so teenagers in line outside the Pandemonium Club leaned forward to eavesdrop. It was a long wait to get into the all-ages club, especially on a Sunday, and not much generally happened in line. The bouncers were fierce and would come down instantly on anyone who looked like they were going to start trouble. Fifteen-year-old Clary Fray, standing in line with her best friend, Simon, leaned forward along with everyone else, hoping for some excitement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, come on.&#x201d; The kid hoisted the thing up over his head. It looked like a wooden beam, pointed at one end. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of my costume.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bouncer raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Which is what?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy grinned. He was normal-enough-looking, Clary thought, for Pandemonium. He had electric blue dyed hair that stuck up around his head like the tentacles of a startled octopus, but no elaborate facial tattoos or big metal bars through his ears or lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a vampire hunter.&#x201d; He pushed down on the wooden thing. It bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fake. Foam rubber. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy&#x2019;s wide eyes were way too bright a green, Clary noticed: the color of antifreeze, spring grass. Colored contact lenses, probably. The bouncer shrugged, abruptly bored. &#x201c;Whatever. Go on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy slid past him, quick as an eel. Clary liked the lilt to his shoulders, the way he tossed his hair as he went. There was a word for him that her mother would have used&#x2014;insouciant.<br> <br>&#x201c;You thought he was cute,&#x201d; said Simon, sounding resigned. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary dug her elbow into his ribs, but didn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br><br> <br>Inside, the club was full of dry-ice smoke. Colored lights played over the dance floor, turning it into a multicolored fairyland of blues and acid greens, hot pinks and golds.<br> <br>The boy in the red jacket stroked the long razor-sharp blade in his hands, an idle smile playing over his lips. It had been so easy&#x2014;a little bit of a glamour on the blade, to make it look harmless. Another glamour on his eyes, and the moment the bouncer had looked straight at him, he was in. Of course, he could probably have gotten by without all that trouble, but it was part of the fun&#x2014;fooling the mundies, doing it all out in the open right in front of them, getting off on the blank looks on their sheeplike faces.<br> <br>Not that the humans didn&#x2019;t have their uses. The boy&#x2019;s green eyes scanned the dance floor, where slender limbs clad in scraps of silk and black leather appeared and disappeared inside the revolving columns of smoke as the mundies danced. Girls tossed their long hair, boys swung their leather-clad hips, and bare skin glittered with sweat. Vitality just poured off them, waves of energy that filled him with a drunken dizziness. His lip curled. They didn&#x2019;t know how lucky they were. They didn&#x2019;t know what it was like to eke out life in a dead world, where the sun hung limp in the sky like a burned cinder. Their lives burned as brightly as candle flames&#x2014;and were as easy to snuff out.<br> <br>His hand tightened on the blade he carried, and he had begun to step out onto the dance floor when a girl broke away from the mass of dancers and began walking toward him. He stared at her. She was beautiful, for a human&#x2014;long hair nearly the precise color of black ink, charcoaled eyes. Floor-length white gown, the kind women used to wear when this world was younger. Lace sleeves belled out around her slim arms. Around her neck was a thick silver chain, on which hung a dark red pendant the size of a baby&#x2019;s fist. He only had to narrow his eyes to know that it was real&#x2014;real and precious. His mouth started to water as she neared him. Vital energy pulsed from her like blood from an open wound. She smiled, passing him, beckoning with her eyes. He turned to follow her, tasting the phantom sizzle of her death on his lips.<br> <br>It was always easy. He could already feel the power of her evaporating life coursing through his veins like fire. Humans were so stupid. They had something so precious, and they barely safeguarded it at all. They threw away their lives for money, for packets of powder, for a stranger&#x2019;s charming smile. The girl was a pale ghost retreating through the colored smoke. She reached the wall and turned, bunching her skirt up in her hands, lifting it as she grinned at him. Under the skirt, she was wearing thigh-high boots.<br> <br>He sauntered up to her, his skin prickling with her nearness. Up close she wasn&#x2019;t so perfect: He could see the mascara smudged under her eyes, the sweat sticking her hair to her neck. He could smell her mortality, the sweet rot of corruption. Got you, he thought.<br> <br>A cool smile curled her lips. She moved to the side, and he could see that she was leaning against a closed door. NO ADMITTANCE&#x2014;STORAGE was scrawled across it in red paint. She reached behind her for the knob, turned it, slid inside. He caught a glimpse of stacked boxes, tangled wiring. A storage room. He glanced behind him&#x2014;no one was looking. So much the better if she wanted privacy.<br> <br>He slipped into the room after her, unaware that he was being followed.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Simon said, &#x201c;pretty good music, eh?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary didn&#x2019;t reply. They were dancing, or what passed for it&#x2014;a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens&#x2014;in a space between a group of teenage boys in metallic corsets, and a young Asian couple who were making out passionately, their colored hair extensions tangled together like vines. A boy with a lip piercing and a teddy bear backpack was handing out free tablets of herbal ecstasy, his parachute pants flapping in the breeze from the wind machine. Clary wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention to their immediate surroundings&#x2014;her eyes were on the blue-haired boy who&#x2019;d talked his way into the club. He was prowling through the crowd as if he were looking for something. There was something about the way he moved that reminded her of something . . . <br> <br>&#x201c;I, for one,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;am enjoying myself immensely.&#x201d;<br> <br>This seemed unlikely. Simon, as always, stuck out at the club like a sore thumb, in jeans and an old T-shirt that said MADE IN BROOKLYN across the front. His freshly scrubbed hair was dark brown instead of green or pink, and his glasses perched crookedly on the end of his nose. He looked less as if he were contemplating the powers of darkness and more as if he were on his way to chess club.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d; Clary knew perfectly well that he came to Pandemonium with her only because she liked it, that he thought it was boring. She wasn&#x2019;t even sure why it was that she liked it&#x2014;the clothes, the music made it like a dream, someone else&#x2019;s life, not her boring real life at all. But she was always too shy to talk to anyone but Simon.<br> <br>The blue-haired boy was making his way off the dance floor. He looked a little lost, as if he hadn&#x2019;t found whom he was looking for. Clary wondered what would happen if she went up and introduced herself, offered to show him around. Maybe he&#x2019;d just stare at her. Or maybe he was shy too. Maybe he&#x2019;d be grateful and pleased, and try not to show it, the way boys did&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d know. Maybe&#x2014;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy straightened up suddenly, snapping to attention, like a hunting dog on point. Clary followed the line of his gaze, and saw the girl in the white dress.<br> <br>Oh, well, Clary thought, trying not to feel like a deflated party balloon. I guess that&#x2019;s that. The girl was gorgeous, the kind of girl Clary would have liked to draw&#x2014;tall and ribbon-slim, with a long spill of black hair. Even at this distance Clary could see the red pendant around her throat. It pulsed under the lights of the dance floor like a separate, disembodied heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;that this evening DJ Bat is doing a singularly exceptional job. Don&#x2019;t you agree?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary rolled her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer; Simon hated trance music. Her attention was on the girl in the white dress. Through the darkness, smoke, and artificial fog, her pale dress shone out like a beacon. No wonder the blue-haired boy was following her as if he were under a spell, too distracted to notice anything else around him&#x2014;even the two dark shapes hard on his heels, weaving after him through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary slowed her dancing and stared. She could just make out that the shapes were boys, tall and wearing black clothes. She couldn&#x2019;t have said how she knew that they were following the other boy, but she did. She could see it in the way they paced him, their careful watchfulness, the slinking grace of their movements. A small flower of apprehension began to open inside her chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Meanwhile,&#x201d; Simon added, &#x201c;I wanted to tell you that lately I&#x2019;ve been cross-dressing. Also, I&#x2019;m sleeping with your mom. I thought you should know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl had reached the wall, and was opening a door marked NO ADMITTANCE. She beckoned the blue-haired boy after her, and they slipped through the door. It wasn&#x2019;t anything Clary hadn&#x2019;t seen before, a couple sneaking off to the dark corners of the club to make out&#x2014;but that made it even weirder that they were being followed.<br> <br>She raised herself up on tiptoe, trying to see over the crowd. The two guys had stopped at the door and seemed to be conferring with each other. One of them was blond, the other dark-haired. The blond one reached into his jacket and drew out something long and sharp that flashed under the strobing lights. A knife. &#x201c;Simon!&#x201d; Clary shouted, and seized his arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Simon looked alarmed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sleeping with your mom, you know. I was just trying to get your attention. Not that your mom isn&#x2019;t a very attractive woman, for her age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you see those guys?&#x201d; She pointed wildly, almost hitting a curvy black girl who was dancing nearby. The girl shot her an evil look. &#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;sorry!&#x201d; Clary turned back to Simon. &#x201c;Do you see those two guys over there? By that door?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon squinted, then shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are two of them. They were following the guy with the blue hair&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The one you thought was cute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s not the point. The blond one pulled a knife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Simon stared harder, shaking his head. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly all business, Simon squared his shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get one of the security guards. You stay here.&#x201d; He strode away, pushing through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary turned just in time to see the blond boy slip through the NO ADMITTANCE door, his friend right on his heels. She looked around; Simon was still trying to shove his way across the dance floor, but he wasn&#x2019;t making much progress. Even if she yelled now, no one would hear her, and by the time Simon got back, something terrible might already have happened. Biting hard on her lower lip, Clary started to wriggle through the crowd.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and smiled. What faint light there was in the storage room spilled down through high barred windows smeared with dirt. Piles of electrical cables, along with broken bits of mirrored disco balls and discarded paint cans littered the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabelle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice name.&#x201d; He walked toward her, stepping carefully among the wires in case any of them were live. In the faint light she looked half-transparent, bleached of color, wrapped in white like an angel. It would be a pleasure to make her fall. . . . &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you here before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re asking me if I come here often?&#x201d; She giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. There was some sort of bracelet around her wrist, just under the cuff of her dress&#x2014;then, as he neared her, he saw that it wasn&#x2019;t a bracelet at all but a pattern inked into her skin, a matrix of swirling lines.<br> <br>He froze. &#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t finish. She moved with lightning swiftness, striking out at him with her open hand, a blow to his chest that would have sent him down gasping if he&#x2019;d been a human being. He staggered back, and now there was something in her hand, a coiling whip that glinted gold as she brought it down, curling around his ankles, jerking him off his feet. He hit the ground, writhing, the hated metal biting deep into his skin. She laughed, standing over him, and dizzily he thought that he should have known. No human girl would wear a dress like the one Isabelle wore. She&#x2019;d worn it to cover her skin&#x2014;all of her skin.<br> <br>Isabelle yanked hard on the whip, securing it. Her smile glittered like poisonous water. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s all yours, boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>A low laugh sounded behind him, and now there were hands on him, hauling him upright, throwing him against one of the concrete pillars. He could feel the damp stone under his back. His hands were pulled behind him, his wrists bound with wire. As he struggled, someone walked around the side of the pillar into his view: a boy, as young as Isabelle and just as pretty. His tawny eyes glittered like chips of amber. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;Are there any more with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy could feel blood welling up under the too-tight metal, making his wrists slippery. &#x201c;Any other what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on now.&#x201d; The tawny-eyed boy held up his hands, and his dark sleeves slipped down, showing the runes inked all over his wrists, the backs of his hands, his palms. &#x201c;You know what I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>Far back inside his skull, the shackled boy&#x2019;s second set of teeth began to grind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shadowhunter,&#x201d; he hissed.<br> <br>The other boy grinned all over his face. &#x201c;Got you,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><br> <br>Clary pushed the door to the storage room open, and stepped inside. For a moment she thought it was deserted. The only windows were high up and barred; faint street noise came through them, the sound of honking cars and squealing brakes. The room smelled like old paint, and a heavy layer of dust covered the floor, marked by smeared shoe prints.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no one in here, she realized, looking around in bewilderment. It was cold in the room, despite the August heat outside. Her back was icy with sweat. She took a step forward, tangling her feet in electrical wires. She bent down to free her sneaker from the cables&#x2014;and heard voices. A girl&#x2019;s laugh, a boy answering sharply. When she straightened up, she saw them.<br> <br>It was as if they had sprung into existence between one blink of her eyes and the next. There was the girl in her long white dress, her black hair hanging down her back like damp seaweed. The two boys were with her&#x2014;the tall one with black hair like hers, and the smaller, fair one, whose hair gleamed like brass in the dim light coming through the windows high above. The fair boy was standing with his hands in his pockets, facing the punk kid, who was tied to a pillar with what looked like piano wire, his hands stretched behind him, his legs bound at the ankles. His face was pulled tight with pain and fear.<br> <br>Heart hammering in her chest, Clary ducked behind the nearest concrete pillar and peered around it. She watched as the fair-haired boy paced back and forth, his arms now crossed over his chest. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You still haven&#x2019;t told me if there are any other of your kind with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Your kind? Clary wondered what he was talkin...</p><h2>Russia and the Russians: A History</h2><p><p> From the Carpathians in the west to the Greater Khingan range in the east, a huge, flat expanse dominates the Eurasian continent. Here, over more than a thousand years, the history and destiny of Russia have unfolded. In a sweeping narrative, one of the English-speaking world's leading historians of Russia follows this story from the first emergence of the Slavs in the historical record in the sixth century C.E. to the Russians' persistent appearances in today's headlines. Hosking's is a monumental story of competing legacies, of an enormous power uneasily balanced between the ideas and realities of Asian empire, European culture, and Byzantine religion; of a constantly shifting identity, from Kievan Rus to Muscovy to Russian Empire to Soviet Union to Russian Federation, and of Tsars and leaders struggling to articulate that identity over the centuries. </p><p> With particular attention to non-Russian regions and ethnic groups and to Russia's relations with neighboring polities, Hosking lays out the links between political, economic, social, and cultural phenomena that have made Russia what it is--a world at once familiar and mysterious to Western observers. In a clear and engaging style, he conducts us through the Mongol invasions, the rise of autocracy, the reigns of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, the battle against Napoleon, the emancipation of the serfs, the Crimean War, the Bolshevik Revolution, Stalin's reign of terror, the two World Wars, the end of the USSR, to today's war against Chechnya. Hosking's history is shot through with the understanding that becoming an empire has prevented Russia from becoming a nation and has perpetuated archaic personal forms of power. This book is the most penetrating and comprehensive account yet of what such a legacy has meant--to Russia, and to the world. </p></p><p>Geoffrey Hosking is retired Professor of Russian History at the University College London.A book intended for a general educated audience and students, a survey of the entire course of Russian history. Hosking is up on the current literature and is invariably judicious in dealing with historiographical controversies.<br> --Terence Emmons, Stanford University<br><br>Hosking's book has comprehensive sweep and a clear writing style.

Highly recommended.<br> --Zachary Irwin (<i>Library Journal</i> 2001-04-01)<br><br>Russia's history, more than that of almost any other country, lends itself to passion and polemic...[Hosking] nevertheless attempts...a dispassionate account.

His book is especially welcome because he links the Communist era, now that it is over, to the enduring themes of the Russian experience...This is a high-quality overview.<br> --Gilbert Taylor (<i>Booklist</i> 2001-04-15)<br><br>There...seems to be a general failure to understand Russians on their own terms--as people who, on one hand are no different than the foreigners trying to analyze them and, on the other hand, think and act in ways that baffle outsiders.

Those seeking answers to these mysteries will welcome Geoffrey Hosking's latest work, <i>Russia and the Russians</i>, a massive survey that begins with the Keivan Rus in the ninth century and ends with Vladimir Putin's arrival in the Kremlin in 2000.

While more valuable to the general reader than the specialist, the latter will still derive insight from the book. This quality is never better illustrated than in the introduction, where Hosking sets forth "the four salient characteristics" that have "imparted to Russia a paradoxical combination of colossal strength and almost crippling weakness." His treatment of the Nikonian reforms, social transformation and terror during Stalin's collectivization, and Gorbachev's perestroika are similarly stimulating...[Hosking's] insight and expertise provide a learning experience for all levels of reader.<br> --G.

Tom and Judy Gordon, a young, attractive couple Corey knows, have been found on their patio, each with a bullet in the head. The local police chief, Sylvester Maxwell, wants Corey&#39;s big-city expertise, but Maxwell gets more than he bargained for. The early signs point to a burglary gone wrong. But because the Gordons were biologists at Plum Island, the offshore animal disease research site rumored to be involved in germ warfare, it isn&#39;t long before the media is suggesting that the Gordons stole something very deadly. Suddenly a local double murder becomes a crime with national and worldwide implications. John Corey doesn&#39;t like mysteries, which is why he likes to solve them.

Touted by experts everywhere as practical, down-to-earth, and easy to read, it warns of cultural issues that are certain to arise, and gives step by step instructions for making the transformation. It clearly explains such tools as continuous flow, value stream mapping, kanban, kaizen, six sigma, just-in-time (JIT), techniques for quick set-ups, and other pillars of the Toyota Production System. It&#39;s full of examples of value stream mapping, how kanban can resolve material supply issues, how kaizen brainstorming can result in startling improvements overnight, how just-in-time (JIT) frees mountains of money tied up in work-in-progress, why Six Sigma quality needs to be built in and not inspected in, how bottlenecks can be eliminated, kanban snafus spotted before they happen, and how instilling a championship mentality in cross-functional teams can lead to increased productivity and continuous improvement that doesn&#39;t stop after the initial kaizen event.</p><p>Jorge Larco holds an MBA from Dartmouth, speaks five languages and has led dozens of conversions to lean in more than half a dozen countries. Bruce Henderson, a Wharton MBA, learned lean directly from Toyota. As CEO of $3.2 billion company, he led a transformation that involved some 30,000 people in more than a 100 manufacturing plants in 16 countries.Foreword Lean Transformation is a leading indicator of a profound change in ourA business culture. Bruce Henderson started his career as a strategy consultant seeking to position businesses so they faced the minimum of competition. Jorge Larco began his business life as an operations manager running plants in a traditional manner. In a previous era they would have had no cause to talk to each other because strategists advising CEOs did not consider operations important and because operating managers lacked a strategic vision for the business extending beyond the walls of their plant. Today (after what they describe as a trip to Toyota boot camp) they are not only talking. They have jointly written a book on how to make lean operations the key strategy for businesses large and small. What's going on here? <p>The answer, I think, is that in a globalized economy with many mature industries it's impossible to avoid competition and critically important to answer a simple question: How can managers create value for customers by eliminating waste in routine operations in plants, engineering, purchasing, distribution, and retail. This is not to say that positional strategies are irrelevantHenderson's company has just consummated a gigantic merger to strengthen its position in several industries. It is to say that mere position is no longer sufficient. The list of mergers that have failed to produce their promised "synergies" due to lack of a lean operating plan is now very long. And down-stream customers, including you and me as ultimate consumers, are placing steadily higher demands on businesses to cut out the waste and perform. The strategists and business raiders of the 1980s have therefore given way to the new business hero of the late 1990sMichael Dellwho has created one of the world's most successful companies by eliminating wasted steps (like the retailer) and installing build-to-order pull systems to give people just what they want just when they want it. </p><p>In the pages of Lean Transformation the authors describe a simple method for making a Dell out of your business, beginning with high-level leadership initiatives to refocus the business, then quickly getting to the down-and-dirty steps needed to transform operations. After a careful reading of this fast-paced text, I hope CEOs will finally get it: Waste can only be eliminated and value created if you pay close attention to every action currently consuming your resources. Ask what's waste and what's value for the end customer, then eliminate the waste. And I hope operations managers will also get it: Brilliant operations employing lean principles is your company's smartest strategy almost without respect to the business you are in. Read Lean Transformation, take notes, screw up your courage, and then explain the new reality to your CEO! </p><p>I hope the readers of Lean Transformation (both CEOs and operations managers) will be at the forefront of the worldwide effort to transform lean thinking from a leading-edge concept into the standard operating practice in every industry. I'm certain the lean thinkers will win before we get very far into the new millennium and I advise the reader to heed Henderson and Larco's warning: If your firm starts down the lean path first you can always stay ahead but if you start later you may find it impossible to catch up!

From the very start, he made clear that he deplored the Soviet domination of Poland, and believed his country was on the wrong side of the Cold War.<br> <br> Over the next nine years, Kuklinski rose quickly in the Polish defense ministry, acting as a liaison to Moscow, and helping to prepare for a "hot war" with the West. But he also lived a life of subterfuge--of dead drops, messages written in invisible ink, miniature cameras, and secret transmitters. In 1981, he gave the CIA the secret plans to crush Solidarity. Then, about to be discovered, he made a dangerous escape with his family to the West. He still lives in hiding in America.<br> <br> Kuklinski's story is a harrowing personal drama about one man's decision to betray the Communist leadership in order to save the country he loves, and the intense debate it spurred over whether he was a traitor or a patriot. Through extensive interviews and access to the CIA's secret archive on the case, Benjamin Weiser offers an unprecedented and richly detailed look at this secret history of the Cold War.<br></p><p>Benjamin Weiser has been a metropolitan reporter for <i>The New York Times</i> since 1997, where he has covered legal issues and terrorism. Before joining the <i>Times</i>, he spent eighteen years as reporter for the <i>Washington Post</i>, where he served on the investigative staff. His journalism has received the George Polk and Livingston awards.<p> During the Cold War, the West had only rare glimpses of the men calling the shots behind the Iron Curtain, and most of the time we saw two-dimensional images of gray, emotionless bureaucrats, seated impassively at U.N. meetings or imperiously observing May Day military parades. We had no gauge of the humanity beneath the pointed hats of Soviet generals or the thought processes behind the dyspeptic visage of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish prime minister who presided over the clampdown on Lech Walesa's Solidarity labor movement in 1981.</p><p> In this well-done biography of Ryszard Kuklinski, a Polish army officer who became a prized double agent for U.S. intelligence, Benjamin Weiser has colored in those drab profiles. A Secret Life is a real-life spy thriller that reveals the passions and tensions faced by Polish leaders under the thumb of Moscow during the 1970s and '80s. Weiser has produced a fascinating portrayal of Kuklinski, who decided that the best way to serve Polish nationalism was to become a spy for the West.</p><p> Putting together a readable narrative about Kuklinski was no easy task, but Weiser, a New York Times metropolitan reporter and former investigative reporter for The Washington Post, made good choices. First off, he established a triangulated method for obtaining classified CIA material, in which a researcher working for him would obtain security clearance, read the documents and make deletions of restricted material before delivering them to the author. Obtaining his own clearance would have forced Weiser to submit his manuscript for CIA approval, the bane of any journalist. </p><p> Weiser's lively narrative describes Kuklinski's nine years working for U.S. intelligence, converting interviews and a mountain of documentation into a page-turner. It's interesting, even quaint, to read about CIA intelligence operations in the years before encrypted, wireless networking, the Internet and other advances changed the nature of communications. Kuklinski and his CIA handlers did everything by hand, spending months searching for drop zones and escape routes, wandering the streets for hours and days to make sure they weren't being tailed.</p><p> But the human dimension is what sets this story apart. Kuklinski chose to be a spy because he hated the Soviet domination of Poland, but we somehow never feel certain about his deeper motivations. Apparently, he was not in it for the money, but because he believed that Poland must be free of Soviet domination. Yet in some correspondence with the CIA, he spoke naively about Soviet intentions in Poland, as if Moscow's utter domination of the country and the rest of the East Bloc were open to question. Any thought that Stalin and his successors cared about political independence would have been out of character for a skilled analyst like Kuklinski, who had seen Soviet troops march into Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p><p> Kuklinski sometimes sagged under the unrelenting pressure of his double life. He had to keep his activities secret from his wife, sons and closest friends, and devised daring methods of photographing and secreting away documents. All the while, Kuklinski moved higher in the military hierarchy. He wrote strategies for war games with the Warsaw Pact and was in the loop as leaders debated whether to send out troops to stop Walesa's labor movement. He dutifully photographed the most sensitive documents and delivered them promptly, so that U.S. policymakers had a top-level mole providing real-time information on military strategy, tactics and matï¿½riel.</p><p> The story has poignant and humorous aspects. Kuklinski maintained written correspondence with his confessor-control agent, code-named Daniel. "I am grateful to you for your friendship," Kuklinski wrote, "which you invariably sustain, caring about and doing everything for my security." </p><p>Although Daniel eventually was reassigned to Vienna, the CIA decided to continue the correspondence in his name. So when Daniel wrote that "our friendship cannot be terminated and will endure and grow in strength forever," the author was actually a harried committee of CIA operatives working overtime to strike a tone that would sound just like Kuklinski's warm-bodied confidante.</p><p> Exhausted and ground down by the pressure, Kuklinski approached the moment of maximum usefulness to the United States in 1981 when the Kremlin threatened to invade Poland and shut down Solidarity. At the climactic moment, Kuklinski thought his cover was blown and contacted the Americans for an emergency rescue.</p><p> It was no surprise that Kuklinski was sentenced to death in absentia by a Polish military court, but the sentence held for years after the fall of communism in Europe. Kuklinski, who became an American citizen, visited Poland occasionally after his conviction was overturned in 1998. He died in Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 10 of this year, at the age of 73. CIA director George Tenet has called him "a true hero of the Cold War," and Walesa said he was "a spy for the right cause." But Jaruzelski said that "to consider him, to treat him, as a hero would be to discredit those who served the army at the time." Weiser, allowing us to reach our own conclusions, raises complex questions about honor and the meaning of loyalty. But it is clear that Kuklinski's decision to work for the United States was an act of great courage and sacrifice. </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Peter Eisner</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

This all-new collection, a fine follow-up for a new era, features recipes that range from peanut butter sandwiches to eggplant caviar, with dishes-and anecdotes-offered by writers of every imaginable stripe, ethnicity, region, and culture in America. </p><p> Contemporary novelists such as National Book Award winners Jonathan Franzen and the late, great Bernard Malamud share space with columnists Dave Barry, P. J. O'Rourke, and Christopher Buckley, with journalists and novelists Andrei Codrescu, Anna Quindlen, and John Berendt, and with poet and novelist Sandra Cisneros. The interspersing of recipes from older and younger generations reveals cookery as creatively diverse as the writings from David Guterson, T. C. Boyle, Elizabeth McCracken, and former First Lady Barbara Bush. </p><p> This unusually tangy assortment of more than 150 recipes runs the gamut from tofu to heart-clogging chili. Writers play fast and loose with ingredients and forewarn readers planning to try them that some of the most seductive recipes are loaded with cholesterol. With such temptations as "Thighs of Delight," "Crevettes Dï¿½sir," a "sexy spaghetti sauce," and a lemon icebox pie that allegedly elicits proposals of marriage, the recipes-and stories revealing their origins-is enticing, bizarre, and promisingly tasty. </p><p> The collection gives particular emphasis to contemporary southern writers-Padgett Powell, Jack Butler, Larry Brown, Ellen Gilchrist, and Josephine Humphreys, among others, although their recipes are often far from being quintessentially "Southern." </p><p> Scintillating with writerly antics and witty histories as transfixing as the recipes themselves, <i>The New Great American Writers Cookbook</i> is not just for daring cooks.

Book is broken down into &#34;four ecologies:&#34; Ecology I: Surfurbia (beaches as biggest thing to envy; focus on indoor/outdoor living; spanish colonial revival; freeways); Ecology II: Foothills (fancy suburbs; mobility-focused architecture; landscape of &#34;do your own thing;&#34; city obsessed with transportation); Ecology III: The Plains of Id (flatlands as &#34;heartland;&#34; Schindler, Neutra, and the International Style ; plain cubes; people should accept the non-existent downtown for what it is: dead); Ecology IV: Autopia (freeway as central feature; L.A. as embodiment of bourgeois good life of urban homestead; people unfairly castigate L.A. when they should examine all the fabulous architecture there and think about why L.A. has inspired so much of that). Argues that &#34;the language of design, architecture and urbanism is Los Angeles is the language of movement&#34; (23).

Tarzan himself is stranded on a desert island, but with the help of Sheeta the panther and Akut the great ape he makes it back to the mainland. There he meets Mugambi, the giant chief of the Wagambi tribe, who becomes Tarzan&#39;s lifelong friend and ally. The group heads into the deep jungle after the kidnappers -- and when Tarzan finds them he lets the beast inside him wreck his vengeance. There&#39;s a beautiful irony, here -- Tarzan has come from the jungle into civilization, and his son must go from civilization to the jungle. Where Tarzan grew up without human guidance or moral direction, he has become an honorable man -- chivalrous, almost noble; a genuinely good man.

A world welterweight and five-time middleweight champion, he had a career that spanned three decades. With his graceful yet powerful style and Hollywood looks -- which he would use to his advantage upon his final retirement from boxing -- he embodied the very essence of the "sweet science." Before he finally hung up his boxing gloves in 1965, at the age of forty-four, Sugar Ray Robinson won 125 consecutive fights, including victories over Henry Armstrong, Kid Gavilan, Carmen Basilio, Jake LaMotta, Rocky Graziano, Gene Fullmer, and Randy Turpin. His successes were not his alone, however. They belonged to his family as well, though those relationships would be marked by neglect and abuse.</p><p>At a time still characterized by discrimination, his victories, like those of Jackie Robinson, represented victories for all black America. And they were all the more symbolic because of the place he chose to call home -- Harlem. Co-written with Robinson's son, Ray Robinson II, and thoroughly researched by <em>Amsterdam News</em> reporter Herb Boyd, <strong>Pound for Pound</strong> is not only a definitive portrait of an emotionally complex man and his family, it is also a portrait of Harlem at the apex of its creativity, a time when Miles Davis was playing at Minton's, Langston Hughes was writing his divine poetry, and a boy from Georgia originally named Walker Smith Jr. would take on the moniker "Sugar."</p></p><p><p>Herb Boyd is a journalist, activist, teacher, and author or editor of twenty-three books, including his latest, <em>The Diary of Malcolm X</em>, edited with Ilyasah Al-Shabazz, Malcolm X&#x2019;s daughter. His articles have been published in the <em>Black Scholar</em>, <em>Final Call</em>, the <em>Amsterdam News</em>, <em>Cineaste</em>, <em>Downbeat</em>, the <em>Network Journal</em>, and the <em>Daily Beast</em>. A scholar for more than forty years, he teaches African American history and culture at the City College of New York in Harlem, where he lives.</p><br><br><p>Ray Robinson II is an independent producer who is currently in the process of establishing a museum in honor of his mother and father.</p>In hands as skilled at the keyboard as Sugar Ray Robinson's were in the ring, this athlete would've been a great biography subject. His charisma and winning technique made him the prince of Harlem in the WWII era (though he's primarily known to modern audiences as Jake LaMotta's opponent in <i>Raging Bull</i>). His friendship with Joe Louis helped eradicate color barriers. His fighting skills may have been equaled since then, but they've never been surpassed&#x2014;he was so powerful he killed a man in the ring. And his excesses of libido, temper, spousal abuse and bling-bling were, Boyd points out, tragic precursors of the behavior of many modern black athletes. Regrettably, the book is minimally competent and, at worst, painful. The journalist rarely devotes more than a few sentences to any of Robinson's matches, some of which, like the LaMotta battles, are the most talked about in boxing history. Instead, readers get puns ("The nation may have been experiencing a rationing of sugar, but the other Sugar was on a rampage") and ostentatious metaphors ("There were many fights when Sugar was a virtuoso pianist with gloves on, a soloist in a pugilist recital, delivering a rapid arpeggio of stiff left jabs"). Robinson is a worthy subject awaiting a more worthy treatment. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They were cooling their heels in Estoril, a resort town on what was once known as the Portuguese Riviera and home to exiled European royalty, including Juan de Borbï¿½n of Spain, Karl von Habsburg of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, and King Carol of Romania, which lent a certain frisson to the Guggenheim party&#x2019;s experience. The town lay between the small coastal fishing village of Cascais and Lisbon, the latter near enough so that members of Peggy&#x2019;s party could make forays there to try to determine when their enforced exile would end for Estoril was just a way station on the journey to America. For the past three weeks they had been waiting for passenger lists that would tell them when they could, all eleven of them, get passage on a Pan American Clipper flight bound for America.<br><br>Lisbon at that time was the single most important point of embarkation for refugees from Europe who wanted to go to the United States.<br>Portugal was a neutral country, and more than 70,000 refugees passed through the port during the war. In the 1942 Hollywood classic Casablanca, Lisbon is the destination for the refugees stranded in Morocco.<br>Because of its transatlantic connections, and because it was a city crowded with foreigners of all nationalities, it became a rendezvous spot for spies and a hotbed of intrigue.<br><br>It is difficult to overstate the anxieties of those wishing to flee the Nazis not to mention the fears of the Jews among them. One observer took measure of the atmosphere on a train heading for Lisbon after the war commenced: Outside the sun beats down in muggy waves, but inside . . . fear like a blanket of dark cobwebs lies over the lives of the passengers. Fear that visas may expire before a destination can be reached. Fear that each new border check might bring a gruff order to get off the train and turn back. Fear that scanty funds may not last until a safe place is reached in the New World. Fear that an outbreak of war in a new theater will slam the gates to freedom at the last moment. Fears by the hundreds by the thousands.&#x201d; The Guggenheim party was not immune to such fears; just keeping their papers together was an anxiety-ridden chore.<br><br>Most refugees got out of Lisbon when they could, and many of them went to America. The war saw a torrent of them making their way to the United States, through Lisbon or through Marseilles, another jumping-off point. In the French city, the American intellectual Varian Fry ran the Emergency Rescue Committee, which conspired to help refugees from a list of two hundred mysteriously given to him in the States. Fry risked everything as he maneuvered around and away from the Gestapo and the Vichy police to secure passage to the United States usually through Lisbon for the writer Hannah Arendt, the painters Marc Chagall and Max Ernst, the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, and the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, among many others.<br><br>Peggy Guggenheim herself, as a Jew, in a very vulnerable position had aided Fry materially, giving the committee 500,000 francs in December 1940: she also arranged and paid for the flight to the United States of Andrï¿½ Breton and his family. The surrealist potentate, whom Peggy would support for a good part of his stay in America, would reassemble his court around Art of This Century, Peggy&#x2019;s wartime gallery in New York City. Among the other artists seeking haven in New York were Chagall, the Chilean-born Roberto Matta Echaurren, Yves Tanguy, Andrï¿½ Masson, and Kurt Seligmann. In fact, Peggy&#x2019;s gallery would become a place where the European refugees could meet with emerging American artists like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Robert Motherwell in a heady mix of cross-pollination and creative collaboration, out of which came abstract expressionism, and which saw the center of the art world move from Paris to New York City.<br><br>The year before Peggy and her party arrived in Lisbon, as a German invasion threatened, she had tried desperately to find ways to preserve her remarkable trove of surrealist and abstract art, which would serve as the anchor of her New York gallery and which by then included, she wrote, a Kandinsky, several Klees and Picabias, a Cubist Braque, a Gris, a Lï¿½ger, a Gleizes, a Marcoussis, a Delaunay, two Futurists, a Severini, a Balla, a Van Doesburg, and a De Stijll&#x2019; Mondrian. Among the surrealist paintings were those of Mirï¿½, Max Ernst, Chirico, Tanguy, Dalï¿½, Magritte and Brauner. The sculpture [included] works by Brancusssssi, Lipchitz, Laurens, Pevsner, Giacometti, Moore, and Arp.&#x201d; When the Louvre declined to store the collection, a museum director in Grenoble had agreed to show it and to store it afterward, but he kept putting off the exhibit. Finally, a shipping agent and family friend suggested that she wrap up all her artworks with the rest of her possessions dishes, furniture, and her car and send them to America as household goods.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman who assembled this remarkable collection was not a conventional collector or patron. Peggy had found her vocation within the larger frame of a life in quest of a personality separate from the confining world of her prominent and wealthy family. Instead of a respectable marriage and a stable home, she had opted for an itinerant life with a succession of male companions, friends, and hangers-on in the literary and artistic circles of France and the United Kingdom. The entourage she took with her on her constant travels across Europe and now to America was an inextricable part of her life, for better or for worse. Out of these circumstances Peggy became one of the most colorful figures in the expatriate community of the 1920s and 1930s, and her New York endeavor would prove the most distinctive and individual in America in the 1940s. The collection she assembled represented her iconoclasm: decidedly modern art, heavily surrealistic, a genre that was sexually and ideologically confrontational. She had been brought up on old masters. True, her uncle Solomon Guggenheim was collecting the works that would form the backbone of his Museum of Non-Objective Painting later the Guggenheim Museum in the Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue in New York but he was thought to be eccentric himself, and at any rate he thoroughly disapproved of his niece having a career in the first place, not to mention dealing in modern art.<br>The party in the hotel dining room on a summer Sunday made a de- cidedly unconventional family picture. Peggy, at the center, was then forty-two and had maintained her attractive, slim figure; her build was delicate in the wrists and ankles, and she waved her hands when she talked, giving her an air of fragility and vulnerability. She could be a strikingly handsome woman, with raven black hair and bright blue eyes, but her crudely applied makeup a crimson gash for her mouth and her famously ugly nose marred her looks. She spoke in vaguely English-sounding, plummy tones, her voice often dryly amused, radiating an ironic air that masked an underlying insecurity about how others regarded her.<br><br>With Peggy in Portugal was her ex-husband Laurence Vail, a harddrinking literary and artistic dabbler, equipped with a volatile temper but a wonderful sense of fun. Once known for his yellow mane, Laurence wore his light, receding hair long on top but clipped underneath, giving him a boyish air even in his late forties. He too had striking blue eyes, and his large, aquiline nose, rather than detracting from his appearance, made him look distinguished. He was a naturally graceful man. In group conversation, he was witty and ebullient, and in one-onone discussion he was capable of creating a rare intimacy. He was also very much the proud papa, affectionate toward his large brood.<br><br>With Vail was his second wife, the writer Kay Boyle, a beautiful and patrician American who had managed to curb her husband&#x2019;s scenes by throwing impressive ones of her own. Kay was at the hotel with the others reluctantly. She spent the rest of the week in a Lisbon clinic, supposedly because of a sinus infection but really to escape family turmoil.<br>Kay intended to divorce Laurence as soon as she got to the States and to marry her new lover, an Austrian baron named Joseph Franckenstein.<br>Between Peggy and Kay there was no love lost. Kay had urged Laurence to obtain custody of their two children by any means possible, including dredging up some nasty gossip about Peggy&#x2019;s family in an attempt to prove that all Guggenheim women were crazy, unfit mothers.<br><br>Laurence eventually won custody of their son, Sindbad, and inevitably Kay and Peggy fought a tug of war over him and later, over Laurence and Peggy&#x2019;s daughter, Pegeen.<br><br>In Estoril, the assorted children, however appreciative of the drama of their situation, were themselves going through difficult passages, especially Peggy&#x2019;s children, Sindbad and Pegeen, eighteen and sixteen respectively.<br>Pegeen, a beautiful blond girl who projected a lost, otherworldly vulnerability, inherited her mother&#x2019;s mannerisms, including a habit of drawing her mouth inward and downward when she laughed.<br>She had bonded deeply with Kay and defended her stepmother&#x2019;s actions which was hard on Peggy. And Sindbad told Kay, You haven&#x2019;t only ruined one man&#x2019;s life. You&#x2019;ve ruined two!&#x201d; With Kay&#x2019;s departure, he felt that he was losing the only real mother he knew. Sindbad, with soulful, large eyes, was darkly handsome, having inherited the paternal, not the maternal, nose. This summer, he was obsessed with losing his virginity, a burden he did not want to bring to America. The adults made this a topic of much amused conversation Peggy urged her son to forswear the local girls, from whom he might acquire a venereal disease.<br><br>One member of the group, Pegeen&#x2019;s close friend Jacqueline Ventadour, fifteen, had fallen in love with Sindbad, creating another subject for gossip among the adults. But Sindbad was still in love with Yvonne Kuhn (the sister of Pegeen&#x2019;s first lover) from the previous summer at Lake Annecy in the French Alps, and paid no notice to Jacqueline&#x2019;s attentions.<br><br>The fourth adult in the mï¿½nage was the surrealist artist Max Ernst, Peggy&#x2019;s latest lover. She had met the German painter just two months before in Marseilles, when they were all arranging for their departures for the United States. Peggy had fallen in love with the strikingly handsome Max, who, with his long whitish blond locks, piercing blue eyes, and beaky nose, closely resembled a younger Laurence. Max had allowed Peggy to take him in tow, grateful to her for making it possible for him to get an emergency exit visa, despite a stay in a French internment camp, as well as for paying his way for which Peggy, driving a hard bargain, got her pick of his artworks. Yet Max was inscrutable.<br>Sometimes boisterous, he could also be frigid and taciturn, emitting waves of European displeasure. With his aloof manner, he kept Peggy guessing. A believer in personal anarchy, he introduced a wild, unpredictable note into a household that already contained enough conflict to keep it at the brink of chaos. On this Sunday, his hair was dyed blue he had soaked it in mouthwash to the children&#x2019;s delight and the grownups&#x2019; titillation; yet he made no reference to the hue of his hair.<br>Max could be a little frightening, especially to the children; just that morning, Kay and Laurence&#x2019;s daughter, the twelve-year-old Apple, had seen him naked in front of the mirror in his room, solemnly applying the blue to his hair.<br><br>Peggy was dismayed by what she felt was Max&#x2019;s lingering affection for the English painter Leonora Carrington, who had turned up in Lis- bon independently. Yet, as she wrote in her memoir, I soon had a definite feeling that my life with [Max] was not yet over.&#x201d; One evening Peggy and Max went over to nearby Cascais, and Peggy took a nude midnight swim: Max implored her to come out of the water, as the sea at night looked threatening and the sight of the naked Peggy bobbing in the black waves frightened him. Afterward, Peggy dried herself with her chemise and they made love on the rocks. Repairing to a nearby chichi hotel bar, Peggy hung her chemise on the bar railing to dry as they sipped their brandy. Max loved my unconventionalities,&#x201d; Peggy later recorded.<br><br>That evening in late June, Peggy sat, as was her custom, at the head of the great table, with Max on one side and Laurence on the other. Kay, sitting next to the various children, tended to them and generally ignored the other adults, though at one point she piped up to tell Peggy she had heard a rumor that the ship carrying Peggy&#x2019;s art collection to the United States had sunk, a malicious remark she repeated several times during the group&#x2019;s long wait in Portugal. Peggy had been greatly relieved when she saw her collection off for America, but now her relief gave way to worry about its safe passage. Her father had gone down with the Titanic, and Peggy had a deep mistrust of boats.<br><br> Our life in the hotel was rather strange,&#x201d; Peggy later wrote fondly.<br>She hugely enjoyed the confusion their seating arrangement caused the hotel staff. No one knew whose wife I was or what connection Kay . . .<br>had with us,&#x201d; Peggy wrote. Once, the hotel&#x2019;s head porter nicknamed, by Laurence, Edward the Seventh, because of his resemblance to the English king took a telephone call from Peggy with information about when her train would arrive in Estoril. [H]e guessed my dilemma and, not knowing to whom I wanted the message delivered, went to the dining room and facing both Laurence and Max, said impersonally, Madam arrives on the nine o&#x2019;clock train.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>It was no accident that Peggy took the presiding post at the table. It was she who was paying the $550 Clipper fare (roughly more than $6,000 in today&#x2019;s currency) for everyone in her party, with the exception of Jacqueline Ventadour. In Marseilles, the wartime hub of visa activity and travel arrangements for those seeking to leave Europe, she had arranged for her party&#x2019;s travel documents and for money from the Banque de France to be transferred to her account, and she made sure that everyone&#x2019;s passports registered the sums.<br><br>What this footloose, unconventional, gypsyish collection of expatri- ates had in common was Peggy. She was the glue that held them together.<br>The entire band would be going to America because they had to, not because they wanted to. Peggy, Kay, and Laurence Laurence especially, having grown up in Europe had adapted themselves to expatriate life. They viewed the United States (from a distance) as commercialistic and tawdry, devoted exclusively to business. Max was essentially stateless and had been for some time; there was no place for him in Germany or in any other European country for that matter. He would go where the winds of change carried him. Peggy, however much she may have dreaded revisiting the city of her childhood, had been frustrated by the shutdown of her artistic efforts by the war and saw only possibility in a new life in America. She and her collection, she hoped, would find a worthy home, and Peggy could continue a life among artists and other creative people.<br><br>It was in Europe that Peggy Guggenheim had asserted her independence and begun to sketch out a role for herself as a patron, collector, and occasional savior to a generation of modernists.With her marriage to Laurence at twenty-four in 1922, Peggy had put behind he...</p><h2>Houghton Mifflin Reading: Rd Mystry Plumed Serpent 4 Imp MYSTERY PLUMED SERPENT</h2><p>Houghton Mifflin Reading: Rd Mystry Plumed Serpent 4 Imp MYSTERY PLUMED SERPENT</p><p></p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Claw (Modesty Blaise series)</h2><p>This crime adventure begins when heroine Modesty Blaise finds Luke Fletcher, one of Britain's greatest artists, lost on a raft in the middle of the ocean.

He discovers its power to change who we are and the society we have become. Compassion, he concludes, is "a prescription for authentic joy." <br><br>Can tapping into one simple human trait, hardwired into our nervous system and just waiting to be awakened, transform our lives and the world at large? Could it help us enjoy new levels of happiness and contentment? Exploring his subject through the multiple lenses of psychology and biology, pop culture and theology, history and philosophy, Barasch weaves a stirring, unforgettable account of his search to find within himself and others: the ability to live compassionately.<br><br>He examines such fascinating questions as: What can we learn from exceptionally empathetic people? Can we increase our kindness quotient with practice? How do we open our hearts to those who do us harm? What if the great driving force of our evolution were actually "survival of the kindest?" <br><br>Drawing from influences as disparate as Buddhist monks and skeptical neuroscientists, Barasch creates a riveting, persuasive argument that a simple shift in consciousness can have a tremendous, lasting impact on our psyches, our relationships, our health--and the very fate of the Earth.</p><p>MARC IAN BARASCH, an award-winning writer, editor, songwriter, and television producer is former editor-in-chief of New Age Journal, which won a National Magazine Award.

He lives in Boulder, Colorado.&#x201c;Writing in a friendly, upbeat voice, Barasch (Healing Dreams ) is never pious as he ponders the meaning of compassion, its healing properties and the wisdom of the compassionate, from St. Francis and the Dalai Lama to caring individuals in Barasch's own life. Touching on psychology, social science and evolutionary biology, Barasch, former editor-in-chief of New Age Journal , explores his theme in a lively autobiographical style, with firsthand reportage, such as living temporarily as a homeless person. The compassionate life is not only liberating, it genuinely feels good, he says. But how do we overcome our innately self-serving tendencies? Barasch finds among bonobo chimpanzees a model for caring group behavior that he believes undermines Darwin's evolutionary idea of the survival of the fittest. He reports on new research that shows how love and caring may actually drive the bodily system, and he converses with an extraordinarily altruistic kidney donor and a father who has forgiven the killer of his daughter. He also observes an Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, and reconciliations in Rwanda. Melding accessible reportage with spiritual quest, Barasch's stirring account is thought-provoking and inspiring.

Using the acronym F.E.A.T., the author examines the four distinctive, factual evidences of Christs resurrection-Fatal torment, Empty tomb, Appearances, and Transformation-making the case for each in a memorable way that believers can readily use in their own defense of the faith.</p></p><p><p>Hank Hanegraaff serves as president and chairman of the board of the North Carolina&#x2013;based Christian Research Institute. He is also host of a nationally syndicated radio broadcast, which is heard daily across the United States and Canada&#x2014;and around the world via the Internet at equip.org. Hank is the author of more than twenty books.&nbsp;</p> <p>Widely regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s leading Christian authors and apologists, Hank is deeply committed to equipping Christians to be so familiar with truth that when counterfeits loom on the horizon, they recognize them instantaneously. Through his live call-in broadcast, Hank answers questions on the basis of careful research and sound reasoning, and interviews today&#x2019;s most significant leaders and thinkers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hank and his wife, Kathy, live in Charlotte, North Carolina, and are parents to twelve children.</p>Evangelical apologist and radio show host Hanegraaff here reads an abridgment of his defense of the resurrection of Jesus, as well as the orthodox doctrine of the event. One of the strengths of this work is its comparisons of major differences between this view of the resurrection and views held by other religions. Hanegraaff's radio program is broadcast throughout the United States and Canada, and his experience is evident in this recording. His voice is expressive and well modulated, as shown by the enthusiasm and energy he displays throughout the recording. However, the music that accompanies the reading is often overwhelming and distracts from his arguments.

Flow, and the Making of Meaning</h2><p>The author of the best-selling Flow profiles the characteristics of a visionary leader, contending that business and work has replaced religion and politics, and demonstrating how business leaders and employees can find happiness while contributing to society. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>In psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's definition of leadership, the personal is political. The best-selling author of <i>Flow</i> interviewed several dozen exemplary CEOs whose wisdom provides the radical job description of the book&#x2019;s premise: "Leaders must make it possible for employees to work with joy, to their heart&#x2019;s content, while responding to the needs of society." Csikszentmihalyi leverages his definition of "flow"&#x2014;-the capacity for full engagement in an activity&#x2014;-to create a blueprint for a workplace in which bringing out the best in workers comes before products and profit. When leaders select and reward employees who find satisfaction at work, they can create an upwardly moral organization.<p> In this view, leadership is a privilege that requires checking ego in the coatroom and peering into the mirror to ask tough questions. For example, "How do I determine if something is right or wrong?" Or, "What is my business doing to benefit human well being?" He offers some inspiring stories from leaders who engage employees to go with the flow, including Body Shop CEO Anita Roddick, Patagonia crown prince Yvon Chouinard, and media mogul Ted Turner. Some of Csikszentmihalyi&#x2019;s advice will sound familiar. Yet he creates a compellingly fresh vision of good business in both a material and spiritual sense. Ultimately, the success of this book lies in its powerful, non-flaky ability to define corporate soul in terms of a company becoming a stakeholder in an entity larger than itself.--<i>Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Hungarian-born Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is the C.

But with the fall of the Soviet Union, they began to spread across the continent, then the world, turning whole populations into vampires--or human cattle. Having overrun India, the far East, and the great cities of North and South America, the forces of Night are now spreading into the countryside to consolidate their conquest.<br><br>In a town on the New Jersey shore, the vampires have just arrived, along with their human henchmen, the cowboys, who round up human cattle for the overlords in return for the promise of eternal life---later. For the vampires wish only a few of their own kind to rule, and feed. The rest of humanity are to be helpless herds, the source of the blood of life. <br><br>Falsely accused of abuse, Father Dan is drunk in a basement waiting for the end. His superior has betrayed the local Catholic congregation and become a vampire. Sister Carolyn has become a formidable killer of cowboys and vampires. Dan's niece, escaped from the conquest of New York, has made her way south to find him. Brought together by Rabbi Zev Wolpin, who is shaken by the vampires' fear of the cross and holy water, they plan their resistance. Against all odds, they discover that there just might be a way for humanity to <i>really</i> fight back. But first they will have to kill the vampire king of New York.<br></p><p>F. Paul Wilson, a<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of horror, adventure, medical thrillers, science fiction, and virtually everything in between, is a practicing physician who resides in Wall, New Jersey.<br>1<br>ZEV...<br>Gasping in horror and revulsion, Zev Wolpin stumbled away from St. Anthony&#x2019;s Church. He stretched his arms before him, reaching into the dark for something, anything, to support him before he fell.<br>Leaves slapped his face, twigs tugged at his graying beard as he plowed into foliage. His bike...where was his bike? He thought he&#x2019;d left it in a clump of bushes, but obviously not this clump. Had to find it, had to get away from this place. But the dark made him disoriented...the dark, and what he&#x2019;d just witnessed.<br>He&#x2019;d heard whispers, stories he couldn&#x2019;t, wouldn&#x2019;t, believe, so he&#x2019;d come to see for himself, to prove them wrong. Instead...<br>Zev bent at the waist and retched. Nothing but a bubble of bile and acid came up, searing the back of his throat.<br>The whispers were only partly true. The truth was worse. The truth was unspeakable.<br>He straightened and looked around in the darkness. Wan light from the crescent moon in the cloud-streaked sky made the shadows deeper, and Zev feared the shadows. Then he spotted a curving glint of light from the chrome on his bike&#x2019;s front wheel. He ran to it, yanked it by the handlebars from its hiding place, and hopped on.<br>His aging knees protested as he pedaled away along dark and silent streets lined with dark and silent houses, heading south when he should have been going west, but <i>away</i> was all that mattered now.<br>Lakewood was a small town, maybe ten miles from the Atlantic Ocean; a place where the Rockefeller family was said to have vacationed. So it didn&#x2019;t matter much if he headed south or north, he wouldn&#x2019;t be far from the place he now called home. The town was once home to fifty thousand or more before the undead came. Now he&#x2019;d be surprised if there were a thousand left. He&#x2019;d heard it was the same all up and down the East Coast.<br>The exertion helped clear his mind. He had to be careful. Prudent he hadn&#x2019;t been. In fact, he&#x2019;d been downright reckless tonight, venturing out after sundown and sneaking up on St. Anthony&#x2019;s. <i>Schmuck</i>! What had he been thinking? He prayed he didn&#x2019;t pay for it with his life. Or worse.<br>He shuddered at the thought of ending up the victim in a ceremony like the one he&#x2019;d witnessed tonight. He had to find temporary shelter until dawn. Even then he wouldn&#x2019;t be safe, but at least there wouldn&#x2019;t be so many shadows.<br>The blue serge suit coat that had once fit rather snugly now hung loose on his half-starved frame and flapped behind him as he rode. He&#x2019;d had to punch new holes in his belt to hold up the pants. He&#x2019;d complained so often about not being able to lose weight. Nothing to it, really. Simply don&#x2019;t eat.<br>His ever-hungry stomach rumbled. How could it think of food after what he&#x2019;d just seen?<br>A shadow passed over him.<br>A blast of cold dread banished any concern about his next meal. His aging neck protested as he glanced up at the sky, praying to see a cloud near the moon. But the glowing crescent sat alone in a clear patch of night.<br>No! Please! He increased his speed, his legs working like pistons against the pedals. Not a flying one!<br>Zev heard something like a laugh above and behind him. He ducked, all but pressing his face to the handlebars. Something swooped by, clawing at the back of his coat as it passed. Its grip slipped but the glancing impact was enough to disrupt Zev&#x2019;s balance. His front wheel wobbled, the bike tipped to the left and hit the curb, sending him flying.<br>Zev landed hard on his left shoulder, his lungs emptying with a grunt. His momentum carried him onto his back. What he saw circling above him made him forget his pain. He rolled over and struggled to his feet. He instinctively checked the yarmulke clipped to his thinning gray hair, then gripped the cross dangling from a string around his neck. That might save him in close quarters, but not from a creature that could swoop down from any angle. He felt like a field mouse under the cold gaze of a hawk.<br>He started running. He didn&#x2019;t know where he was going but knew he had to move. The bike was no good. He needed a tight space where his back was protected and he could use the cross to keep his attacker at bay. One of these houses, maybe. A basement, even a sewer drain&#x2014;anyplace but out here in the open where&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Here! Over here!&#x201d;<br>A woman&#x2019;s voice, calling in a stage whisper to his left. Zev looked across an overgrown lawn, saw only a large tree, a pine of some sort with branches almost brushing the ground.<br>&#x201c;Quick! In the tree!&#x201d;<br>A trap maybe. A team this could be&#x2014;a winged one driving prey into the arms of another on the ground. He&#x2019;d never heard of anything like it, but that meant nothing.<br>A glance over his shoulder showed him that the creature had half folded its wings and was diving his way from above. No choice now. Zev veered left for the tree and whatever waited within its shadowed branches.<br>He was almost there when the woman&#x2019;s voice shouted, &#x201c;Down!&#x201d;<br>Zev obeyed, diving for the grass. He heard a hiss of rage, felt the wind from the creature&#x2019;s wings as it hurtled past no more than a foot or two above him. He lurched back to his feet and staggered forward. Pale hands reached from the branches and pulled him into the shadows.<br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; the woman said.<br>He couldn&#x2019;t see her&#x2014;she was a shadow among the shadows&#x2014;but her voice sounded young.<br>&#x201c;Yes. No. If you mean am I hurt, No.&#x201d;<br>But all right? No, he was not all right. Never again would he be all right.<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; She grabbed his hands and pressed them against a tree limb. &#x201c;Hold on to this branch. Steady it while I try to break it. Quick, before it makes another pass.&#x201d;<br>The dead branch sat chest high and felt about half an inch in diameter. With Zev steadying it, the woman threw her weight hard against it. The wood snapped with a loud crack.<br>&#x201c;What are you&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br>She shushed him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming back.&#x201d;<br>She moved to the edge of the trees, carrying the branch with her. Zev watched her, silhouetted against the moonlit lawn. Average height, short dark hair were all he gained about her looks. He saw her crouch, then hurl her branch like a spear at the creature as it swooped by on another pass. She missed and high-pitched derisive laughter trailed into the sky.<br>She returned to Zev, stopped on the other side of the broken branch, and patted the front of his shirt. She pulled him close and whispered in his ear.<br>&#x201c;Your cross&#x2014;tuck it away.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No! It will&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do as I say. They can see in the dark. And try to look frightened.&#x201d;<br>Try? Who had to try?<br>She put an arm around him to hold him close, keeping the branch between them.<br>Another whisper: &#x201c;Pull out that cross when I tell you.&#x201d;<br>Zev had no idea what she was up to but had nowhere else to turn, so...<br>Her grip on him tightened. &#x201c;Here it comes. Ready...&#x201d;<br>Zev could see it now, a dark splotch among the shadows of the branches, wings spread, gliding in low, arms stretched out before it.<br>&#x201c;...ready...&#x201d;<br>Suddenly it folded its wings and shot at them like a missile.<br>&#x201c;Now!&#x201d;<br>As Zev pulled out the cross he felt the woman shove him away. He lost his balance and tumbled back, saw her fall in the other direction, felt a clawed hand grip his shoulder, heard the creature&#x2019;s screech of triumph rise into a wail of shock and agony as it slammed against the trunk of the tree.<br>Zev regained his feet amid the frantic and furious struggling of the hissing creature. Its charging attack had opened a passage through the branches, lightening the shadows. As he ducked its thrashing wings he realized it had impaled itself on the broken branch. It flopped back and forth like a speared fish, then pushed away from the trunk, trying to dislodge itself from the wood that had pierced its chest.<br>Zev turned to run. Now was his chance to get away from this thing. But what of the woman? He couldn&#x2019;t abandon her.<br>He spotted her standing behind the creature. She&#x2019;d hiked up her already short skirt and kicked at the thing&#x2019;s back, shoving it further onto the branch. The creature howled and thrashed, and in its struggles broke the branch off the trunk with a gunshot crack.<br>Free now, it whirled and staggered out into the moonlight. Its wings flapped but couldn&#x2019;t seem to lift it. Perhaps ten feet beyond the branches it dropped to its knees. The woman was right behind it, giving it another kick. It rolled onto its back, clawing at the wooden shaft that jutted two or three feet from its chest. Its movements were weaker now, its wings lay crumpled beneath it. Howling and writhing in agony, it gripped the branch and started to slide it out of its chest.<br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; the woman cried.<br>She gripped the upper end, shoving it back down and leaning on it to hold it in place.<br>&#x201c;This is for Bern!&#x201d; she screamed, naked fury rawing her voice. &#x201c;This is what you made me do to her! How does it feel? How does it <i>feel</i>?&#x201d;<br>For an instant Zev wondered who was more frightening, this screeching woman or the struggling monster she held pinned to the earth.<br>The creature clawed and kicked at her, almost knocking her over. He had to help. If that thing got free...<br>Mouth dry, heart pounding, Zev forced himself from the shadows and added his own weight to the branch. He felt it punch deeper into the thing&#x2019;s chest. Then a sickening scrape as it thrust past ribs and into the ground beneath.<br>The creature&#x2019;s struggles became abruptly feebler. He saw now that it was a female. It might have been beautiful once, but the sickly pallor and the bared fangs robbed it of any attractiveness.<br>Finally it shuddered and lay still. Zev watched in amazement as its wings shriveled and disappeared.<br>&#x201c;<i>Gevalt</i>!&#x201d; he whispered, although he didn&#x2019;t know why. &#x201c;You did it! You killed one!&#x201d;<br>He&#x2019;d heard they could be killed&#x2014;all the old folk tales said they could be&#x2014;but he&#x2019;d never actually seen one die, never even met anyone who had.<br>It was good to know they could be killed.<br>&#x201c;<i>We</i> did.&#x201d; She finally released her grip on the branch but her gaze remained locked on the creature. &#x201c;If you have a soul,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;may God have mercy on it.&#x201d;<br>What was this? Like a harpy, she screeches, then she blesses the thing. A madwoman, this was.<br>She faced him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for my outburst. I...it&#x2019;s just...&#x201d; She seemed to lose her train of thought, as if something had distracted her. &#x201c;Anyway, thank you for the help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You saved my life, young lady. It&#x2019;s me who should be thanking.&#x201d;<br>She was staring at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Rabbi Wolpin, aren&#x2019;t you.&#x201d;<br>Shock stole his voice for a few heartbeats. She knew him?<br>&#x201c;Why...yes. But I don&#x2019;t recognize...&#x201d;<br>She laughed. A bitter sound. &#x201c;Please, God, I hope not.&#x201d;<br>He could see her now. Nothing familiar about her features, no particular style to her short dark hair. He noticed a tiny crescent scar on the right side of her chin. Heavy on the eye makeup&#x2014;very heavy. A tight red sweater and even tighter short black skirt hid little of her slim body. And were those fishnet stockings?<br>A prostitute? In these times? Such a thing he never would have dreamed. But then he remembered hearing of women selling themselves to get food and favors.<br>&#x201c;So, you know me how?&#x201d;<br>She shrugged. &#x201c;I used to see you with Father Cahill.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Joe Cahill,&#x201d; Zev said, feeling a burst of warmth at the mention of his friend&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;I was just over at his church. I saw...&#x201d; The words choked off.<br>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;ve&#x2014;&#x201d; She waved her hand before her face. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s starting to stink already. Must be an older one.&#x201d;<br>Zev looked down and saw that the creature was already in an advanced state of rot.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get out of here,&#x201d; the woman said, backing away. &#x201c;They seem to know when one of their kind dies. Get your bike and meet me by the tree.&#x201d;<br>Zev continued to stare at the corpse. &#x201c;Are they always so hard to kill?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the branch went all the way through the heart at first.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Nu</i>? You&#x2019;ve done this before?&#x201d;<br>Her expression was bleak as she looked at him. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not talk about it.&#x201d;<br>When Zev wheeled his bike back to the tree he found her standing beside a child&#x2019;s red wagon, an old-fashioned Radio Flyer. A book bag emblazoned with <i>St. Anthony&#x2019;s School</i> lay in the wagon. He hadn&#x2019;t noticed either earlier. She must have had them hidden among the branches.<br>She said, &#x201c;You mentioned you were at St. Anthony&#x2019;s. Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To see if what I&#x2019;d heard was true.&#x201d; The urge to retch gripped Zev again. &#x201c;To think that was Father Cahill&#x2019;s church.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t the pastor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not in name, maybe, but they were his flock. He was the glue that held them together. Someone should tell him what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh,<br>yes. That would be wonderful. But nobody knows where he is, or if he&#x2019;s even alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br>Her hand shot out and gripped his arm, squeezing. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Zev said, taken aback by her intensity. &#x201c;At least I think so.&#x201d;<br>Her grip tightened. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br>He wondered if he&#x2019;d made a mistake telling her. He tried not to sound evasive. &#x201c;A retreat house. Have I been there? No. But it&#x2019;s near the beach, I&#x2019;m told.&#x201d;<br>True enough, and he knew the address. After Joe had been moved out of St. Anthony&#x2019;s rectory to the retreat house, he and Zev still shared many phone conversations. At least until the creatures came. Then the phones stopped working and Zev&#x2019;s time became devoted more to survival than to keeping up with old friends.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to find him! You&#x2019;ve got to tell him! He&#x2019;ll come back when he finds out and he&#x2019;ll make them pay!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A <i>mensch</i>, he is, I agree, but only one man.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No! Many of his parishioners are still alive, but they&#x2019;re afraid. They&#x2019;re defeated. But if Father Joe came back, they&#x2019;d have hope. They&#x2019;d see that it wasn&#x2019;t over. They&#x2019;d regain the will to fight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Like you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m different,&#x201d; she said, the fervor slipping from her voice. &#x201c;I never lost the will to fight. But my circumstances are special.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not important. <i>I&#x2019;m</i> not important. But Father Joe is. Find him, Rabbi Wolpin. Don&#x2019;t put it off. Find him tomorrow and tell him. When he hears what they&#x2019;ve done to his church he&#x2019;ll come back and teach them a lesson they&#x2019;ll never forget!&#x201d;<br>Zev didn&#x2019;t know about that, but it would be good to see his young friend again. Searching him out would be a <i>mitzvah</i> for St. Anthony&#x2019;s, but might be good for Zev as well. It might offer some shape to his life...a life that had devolved to mere existence, an endless, mind-numbing round of searching for food and shelter while avoiding the creatures by night and the human slime who did their bidding during the day.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Zev said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to find him. I won&#x2019;t promise to bring him back, because such a decision will not be mine to make. But I promise to look for him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tomorrow?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;First light. And who should I say sent me?&#x201d;<br>The woman turned away and shook her head. &#x201c;No one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t tell me your name?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not important.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you seem to know him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Once, yes.&#x201d; Her voice grew thick. &#x201c;But he wouldn&#x2019;t recognize me now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can be so sure?&#x201d;<br>She nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve fallen too far away. There&#x2019;s no coming back for me, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br>She&#x2019;d been through something terrible, this one. So had everyone who was still alive, including Zev, but her experience, whatever it was, had made her a little <i>meshugeh</i>. More than a little, maybe.<br>She started walking away, looking almost silly dragging that little red wagon behind her.<br>&#x201c;Wait...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just find him,&#x201d; she said withou...</p><h2>Weaving in the Peruvian Highlands</h2><p><p>A richly illustrated look at Andean weaving, which embodies the living history and culture of the Peruvian highlands, this guide extensively catalogs many of the intricate patterns found in traditional Peruvian textiles.

There are several reasons for the wide and warm acclaim which has been accorded to the author, the late Professor Edward J. Young, of Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia.<br><br>Thy Word is Truth explains the importance of the doctrine of biblical inspiration. Without it the reliability of the Bible is in serious doubt, the integrity of Jesus is put in question, and the only final authority men have in matters of faith becomes their own conscience. If we cannot trust what Scripture says about itself, how can we trust what it says about God, about man s need, or about Christ s saving power?<br><br>Furthermore, Thy Word is Truth explains why this doctrine has been so fiercely contested. It is precisely because it lies at the heart of Christianity. While it is said that only what we think of Christ really matters, Professor Young urges us to recognize that what we think of him inevitably depends on the reliability of the Bible. If it fails us, we can know nothing for certain about Christ. He has chosen to make himself known through Scripture.<br><br>To write such a book as this demands special gifts, and a rare combination of qualifications. E.J. Young possessed these to an unusual degree. He was an outstanding linguist and biblical scholar, and knew the text of the Bible intimately. He understood the doctrinal issues which are at stake. He possessed a lucid mind and pen. He was also willing to rest his own soul on the convictions to which Scripture itself drove him-even when this involved swimming against the tide of the world of scholarship in which he moved with high distinction. His blend of true scholarship with humble commitment to Christ makes this study a reliable introduction to a question which continues to haunt the church at the beginning of the 21st century.</p><p>Edward Joseph Young (1907-1968) was Professor of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary from 1936 until his death.

Not surprisingly, the teachings and imagery of this international religion are vast and complex, and the task of deciphering Buddhist symbolism can seem as challenging as the search for enlightenment itself. All the principal symbols, objects, and figures of Buddhist worship are gathered here in a rich, informative, and easy-to-use book that will serve equally well as an art-lover's reference tool and as an introduction to the principles of the religion. Photographs and two-color line drawings and maps accompany the explanatory texts. With a comprehensive glossary of key Buddhist terms and a well-researched bibliography, this book will prove indispensable to anyone with an interest in Buddhism and its arts. 304 illustrations</p><p>Meher McArthur is an art historian and the former curator of East Asian Art at the Pacific Asian Museum in California. She is the author of Reading Buddist Art: An Illustrated Guide to Buddhist Signs and Symbols, The Arts of Asia: Materials, Techniques, Styles, and Confucius: A Throneless King. She lives in Pasadena, CA.McArthur, curator of East Asian Art at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, has set for herself no small task: to create a concise, accessible primer to the intricate world of Buddhist art. She succeeds, although she eschews most chronological and geographical developments in Buddhist painting, sculpture, architecture and other arts in favor of a simplified, broad overview. After an excellent distillation of Buddhism's 2,500-year history, she focuses on the key figures in the bewilderingly complex Buddhist pantheon, succinctly discussing each one's identity, principal areas of worship, and specific attributes. Next, she identifies the symbolism and function of Buddhism's major ritual objects, symbols and signs, such as the meaning of the various mudras (hand gestures) of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Finally, she briefly discusses 14 major Buddhist sites in Asia, including the unfortunate destruction of the two colossal standing Buddhas in Afghanistan at the hands of the Taliban in 2001. She observes the statues' impressive international appeal, even in antiquity: "In the seventh century [CE], the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang" took note of the two large Buddhas "with their golden hues and dazzling ornamentation." The book itself is generously embellished with 304 black-and-white illustrations, including dozens of original line drawings washed with olive-colored highlights. McArthur avoids issues of Buddhist doctrine to a fault; integrating into her discussion the distinguishing characteristics of the various schools of Buddhism (mainly Mahayana, Vajrayana and Theravada) would clarify elements of each tradition's unique art forms and would add texture to her otherwise superb introduction. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Threading My Prayer Rug: One Woman&#39;s Journey from Pakistani Muslim to American Muslim</h2><p><b>Shortlisted for the 2018 William Saroyan International Prize for Writing<br>ONE OF <i>BOOKLIST'</i>S TOP TEN RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY BOOKS OF 2016<br>ONE OF <i>BOOKLIST'</i>S TOP TEN DIVERSE NONFICTION BOOKS OF 2017<br>Honorable Mention in the 2017 San Francisco Book Festival Awards, Spiritual Category<br>This enthralling story of the making of an American is also a timely meditation on being Muslim in America today.</b><br><br><i>Threading My Prayer Rug</i> is a richly textured reflection on what it is to be a Muslim in America today.

Inspired by the bunch of violets and cuckoo-buds Gabriel brings into the workroom, Brother Stephen conceives a new idea for an illuminated border. Instead of painting the border with scrolls and birds and flowers in the conventional way, he would decorate the book with borders of gold on which he would paint in realistic fashion the meadow wildflowers, and bees and butterflies, and all the little flying creatures. As Brother Stephen&#39;s color grinder, Gabriel makes the ink, grinds the gold, gathers the flowers, and prepares the colors for him. After the book is completed, Gabriel slips into the book a sheet on which he has penned a prayer to Lady Anne: &#34;I, Gabriel Viaud, am Brother Stephen&#39;s colour-grinder; and I have made the ink for this book, and the glue, and caught the eels, and ground the gold and colours, and ruled the lines and gathered the flowers for the borders, and so I pray the Lord God will be kind and let my father out of prison in Count Pierre&#39;s castle, and tell Count Pierre to give us back our meadow and sheep, for we cannot pay the tax, and mother says we will starve.&#34; How his prayer is answered unfolds in the ensuing chapters.

First of a class of superships built secretly before World War II, she was the proudest technological achievement of a nation newly emerged as a naval power. Yet before she was commissioned, in December 1941, the Japanese themselves rendered the battleship obsolete by their carrier strike against Pearl Harbor. Throughout most of the Pacific war the pride of the Imperial Japanese navy was relegated to minor roles - until the American invasion of Okinawa. It was then, with the navy whittled away, that a desperate Japanese High Command decided to throw Yamato into the battle. The mighty ship was ordered to attack the invading force - the greatest assemblage of warships the world had ever seen - backed only by eight escorts. No planes or pilots could be spared to provide air cover. Combat directives made it clear that this was a one-way Kamikaze mission. The Japanese were intercepted on April 7, 1945, some 200 miles from Okinawa. American carriers threw more aircraft at the intruders than the Japanese used against Pearl Harbor. Within two hours, Yamato and most of her escorts were sunk or crippled. At final count 260 officers and men were saved from Yamato. The dead totaled 3,063. Russell Spurr sets the story of the Yamato against the background of Japanese suicide war tactics. He has recorded eyewitness accounts from the men involved, Japanese and Americans, from top admirals to fighter pilots to junior ships&#39; gunners. He portrays the reaction of the sailors as they receive and carry out the orders to attack - and to die. He probes the politics and mentality of the Japanese leadership and the morale and spirit of the fighting men and the nation. What emerges is more than a story of a sortie or a ship. To quote the author: &#34;The result...offers some insights into the agonizing dilemma of a misguided, courageous people who persisted in continuing a hopeless war.&#34;</p><p><p> Russell Spurr was based in Hong Kong for more than 20 years as the China and Far East correspondent for the <i>London Daily Express</i> and <i>ABC Radio Network</i>, and the chief correspondent and deputy editor of the <i>Far Eastern Economic Review</i>. He was one of the first Western correspondents to report from Peking after the establishment in 1949 of the People's Republic of China. During World War II Spurr was in the Royal Indian Navy, and served in motor gunboats through most of the Burma campaign. After the Japanese surrender, he was assigned to Kure, Japan, where he first viewed the vacant dock built for the Yamato and began to pursue the story of its demise.

The servants burst in to find Moen, a young man to whom Eber had extended his protection, crouched over the bloody body of the chieftain. Moen&#39;s clothes are drenched in Eber&#39;s blood and he is clutching a bloodstained knife in his hand. There seems no doubt of culpability, but why did Moen kill the gentle and courteous Eber? The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Moen himself cannot tell them - for he is deaf, dumb and blind...Sister Fidelma, advocate of the ancient Irish law courts, is compelled to begin an investigation of the killing in order to present an argument on Moen&#39;s behalf before he is condemned.

An occasional bright flash silhouetted the rounded height, causing shadows to flit briefly across the valley of Araglin within its northern foothills. It was a dark night with storm clouds clustering and racing across the heaven, tumbling over each other as if blown in disarray by the powerful breath of the ancient gods.On the high pastures, the shaggy-coated cattle huddled together, some bellowing fretfully now and then, not just to comfort themselves from the threatening storm but to warn one another of the prevailing scent of ravening wolves whose hungry packs haunted the dark woodlands which bordered the high meadows. In a corner of the pastures, well away from the cattle, a majestic stag stood as an anxious sentinel over his hinds and their calves. Now and then he would thrust his elaborately antlered head skyward and his sensitive nostrils would quiver. In spite of the darkness, the heavy clouds and threatening storm, the beast sensed the approach of dawn beyond the distant eastern peaks.Below in the valley, by the dark, gurgling ribbon of a river, a group of unfortified buildings stood in complete darkness. No dogs were stirring at this hour and it was still too early for the cocks to herald the approach of a new day. Even the birds had not begun their dawn chorus and were still sheltering sleepily in the surrounding trees.Yet one human was stirring at this dark hour; one person wasawakening at this hour of stillness when the world seemed dead and deserted.Menma, the head stableman to Eber, chieftain of Araglin, a tall, ponderous man with a bushy red beard and a fondness for liquor, blinked and threw off the sheepskin from his straw palliasse bed. The occasional flash of lightning lit his solitary cabin. Menma groaned and shook his head as if the action would clear it from the effects of the previous night's drinking. He reached to a table and, with shaky hands, fumbled for the flint and tinder to light the tallow candle which stood upon it. Then he stretched his cramped limbs. In spite of his excessive drinking, Menma was possessed of a mysterious in-built sense of time. All his life he had risen in the dark hour before dawn no matter the lateness of the hour at which he had tumbled, in drunken stupor, into his bed.The big man began his ritual morning cursing of all creation. Menma had a fondness for cursing. Some people began the day with a prayer, others by performing their morning's ablutions. Menma of Araglin began his day by cursing his master, the chieftain Eber, wishing upon him all manner of deaths by choking, by convulsion, by mangling, by dysentery, by poison, by drowning, by smothering and by any other means his meagre imagination could devise. And after he had exhausted such manner of ill-wishing on his master, Menma continued cursing his own existence, his parents for not being rich and powerful; cursing them for being only simple farming folk and thereby ordaining for him a role as a lowly stableman.His own parents had been simple labourers on their richer cousins' farmsteads. They had not succeeded in life and had ordained Menma's own menial existence. Menma was a jealous and bitter man, unhappy with his lot in life.Nevertheless, he rose automatically in the darkness of the early morning and drew on his clothes. He never bothered to wash nor comb the matted tangle of his shoulder-length, red-coloured hairand the great bush of his beard. A gulping draught of <i>corma,</i> the sickly mead that always stood in a jug by his bedside, was all the cleansing he deemed necessary to prepare him for the day. The stench of his body and garments proclaimed, to those near enough to inhale their malefic odour, that Menma and cleanliness were not compatible.He shuffled to the door of his cabin and peered out, blinking up at the darken sky. The thunder still rumbled but he instinctively knew that it would not rain that day in the valley. The storm was on the other side of the mountains and moving along them east to west, keeping parallel to the valley of Araglin. It would not cross northward over the mountains. No; it would be a dry day even if cloudy and cool. The clouds obscured the stars so that he was unable to be precise about the time but he sensed, rather than saw, the pale line of dawn just below the distant eastern peaks.The <i>rath</i> of the chieftain of Araglin still slumbered in the darkness. Although this was no more than an unfortified village, it was courtesy to call the dwelling of a chieftain a <i>rath</i> or fortress.Menma stood at his door and now he began to softly curse the day itself. He resented the fact that everyone was able to sleep on but that he had to be the first to rise. And when he had finished with the day there was Araglin itself to be cursed and he did full justice to his scanty vocabulary.He turned back into his cabin for a moment and blew out the candle before beginning to shuffle along the track that led between the peaceful buildings towards the chieftain's stables. He needed no candle for he had often walked that path before. His first task would be to turn the horses out to pasture, feed the chieftain's hunting hounds, and then to oversee the milking of the chieftain's cattle. And by the time the horses were out in the pasture and the hounds were fed, then the women of the household would be awake and coming to attend the milking. Milking was not a man's job and Menma would not demean himself by doing it. But there had been a cattle raid in the valley recently and Eber, the chieftain,had instructed him to check the milch herd before each milking. It was an affront to the honour of the chieftain that anyone would dare steal even a calf from his herd and Eber had been furious at the news that cattle raiders were threatening the peace of his clan lands. His warriors had scoured the countryside for the culprits but without success.Menma approached the imposing dark outline of the hall of assembly, one of the few great large stone buildings within the ancient <i>rath.</i> The other stone building was Father Gormï¿½n's chapel. The stables were at the back of the rounded construction, just behind the guests' hostel. To approach the stables, Menma had to trudge a circular path around the wooden extensions to the stone hall which housed the private apartments of the chieftain and his family. Menma glanced at the buildings in jealousy. Eber would still be snoring in his bed until well after dawn.Behind his veil of beard, Menna grinned lewdly. He wondered if anyone was sharing Eber's bed that night. Then he frowned angrily. Why Eber? Why not him? What was so special about Eber that he had wealth, power and was able to entice women into his bed? What fate had made him a humble stableman? Why ... ?He paused in mid-stride, head to one side.The darkness seemed soundless. The <i>rath</i> continued to slumber. High, high up among the distant hills came the long, drawn out howl of a wolf breaking the silence. No; it was not that which had caused him to halt. It had been some other noise. A noise he could not quite place.He stood for a moment more but the silence remained. He was just about to dismiss the half heard sound as a trick of the wind when it came again.A low, moaning sound.<i>Was</i> it the wind?Menma suddenly genuflected and shivered. God between him and all evil! Was it one of the dwellers in the hills? The people ofthe <i>sï¿½dh;</i> the little folk in search of souls to carry below into their dark caverns?There came a sudden shriek, not loud but sharp enough to make Menma start, his heart increasing its beat for several seconds. Then the low moaning came again. This time it was a little stronger and more sustained.Menma looked around him. Nothing stirred among the dark shadows of the buildings. No one else seemed to have heard the noise. He tried to locate its origin. It came from the direction of the apartments of Eber himself. In spite of its ethereal quality, Menma could now identify it as human in origin. He sighed in relief for, as brutal in his views of the world as he was, nevertheless, it did not bode well to go up against the folk of the <i>sï¿½dh</i> if they were intent on soul-stealing. He glanced quickly about. The building appeared dark and tranquil. Was Eber ill? He frowned, undecided what to do. Eber was his chieftain, come what may, and Menma had a duty to his chieftain. A duty which not even his bitterness could cause him to neglect.He cautiously made his way to the door of Eber's apartments and tapped softly.'Eber? Are you ill? Do you require assistance?' he called gently.There was no reply. He tapped again, a little louder. When there was still no response, he summoned courage and lifted the latch. The door was not secured, not that he expected it to be. No one secured their doors in the <i>rath</i> of the chieftain of Araglin. He moved inside. He had no trouble adjusting his eyes to the darkness. The room which he had entered was empty. He knew from previous experience that Eber's apartments consisted of two rooms. The first room, in which he stood, was called 'the place of conversation', which was a private reception room for the chieftain, where he discreetly entertained special guests, away from the public gaze of the hall of assembly. Beyond this room was the chieftain's bed chamber.Menma, having ascertained the first room to be empty, turned towards it.The first thing he noticed was a glow of light from beneath the door. The second thing that registered with him was the rising sound of the moaning beyond the door.'Eber!' he called sharply. 'Is there anything wrong? It is I, Menma the stableman.'There was no reply and the moaning sound did not diminish.He moved across to the door and rapped sharply.Hesitating only for a moment, he entered.A lamp was lit on a small table. Menma blinked rapidly to adjust his vision. He was aware of someone kneeling by the bed, someone in a hunched posture, rocking back and forth and whimpering. They were the source of the low moaning sound that he had been hearing. He was aware of the dark stains on the clothes of the figure. Then his eyes widened a fraction. They were blood stains and there was something flashing and glinting in the lamplight, something that the person was clutching in their hands. It was a long bladed dagger.For a moment, Menma stood immobile, fascinated by the spectacle.Then he realised that there was a second person in the room. Someone was lying in the bed beside which the moaning figure was kneeling.Menma stood a pace forward.Sprawled on the bed, naked except for the coverlets twisted around him, was the blood-smeared body of Eber the chieftain. One hand was thrown casually back behind his head. The eyes were wide and staring and seemed alive in the flickering of the lamplight. The chest was a mess of bloody wounds. Menma had seen enough animals slaughtered not to recognise the jagged tearing of injuries caused by a knife. The knife must have been frenziedly plunged, again and again, into the chest of the chieftain of Araglin.Menma half raised his hand to genuflect but then dropped it.'Is he dead?' he demanded hollowly.The figure beside the bed continued to rock back and forth moaning. It did not look up.Menma took another step forward and gazed dispassionately downwards. Then he moved closer, dropping to one knee and reaching towards the pulse in the chieftain's neck. The body already felt cool and clammy. Now that he looked more closely into the eyes, and the lamplight played no tricks with them, he could see that they were set and glazed.Menma drew himself up and stared down in distaste. He hesitated, feeling that in spite of the evidence of his eyes, he had to make sure that Eber was dead. He raised a foot to nudge at the body with the toe of his boot. There was no response. Then he raised his foot and lashed viciously out at the side of the body. No, he was not mistaken. Eber, the chieftain, was dead.Menma turned his gaze to the still moaning figure, which was still clutching the knife. He began to laugh harshly. He suddenly realised that he, Menma the stableman, was going to be rich and powerful just like the cousins he had envied all his life.He was still chuckling when he left the chieftain's apartments and set off in search of Duban, the commander of Eber's bodyguard.THE SPIDER'S WEB.

When a local archaeological team looking for Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal remains turns up a corpse with a watch on its wrist and a bullet in its head, it&#x2019;s up to Bruno to solve the case. But the task will not be easy, not with a meddlesome new magistrate eager to make a strong impression, an ongoing series of attacks by animal rights activists on local foie gras producers, and a nearby summit between France and Spain approaching&#x2014;not to mention two beautiful, brilliant women vying for Bruno&#x2019;s affections. <br><br> Complicating events even further, the professor in charge of the dig is soon reported missing, leading Bruno to suspect that the past and the present are bound up in dangerous ways.

He is also editor in chief emeritus and an international affairs columnist at United Press International.

The early sun was chasing the mist from the wooded hollows that sheltered the small streams flowing busily down to the River Vï¿½zï¿½re. Drops of dew sparkled on the new buds that seemed to have appeared overnight on the bare trees. The air smelled somehow different, fresh and hopeful, and enlivened by the tuneful notes of a dozen different birdsongs. Excited by the change in scents and season, even after his early morning walk through the woods, Gigi the basset hound thrust his nose at the open window of the small police van that descended the steep and curving lane from his master&#x2019;s home. At the wheel, Bruno was singing a half-ï¿½remembered song about springtime in Paris. Vaguely thinking of the duties of the day that stretched before him, when rounding the last bend he was suddenly forced to brake.<br><br>For the first time in his memory, the quiet road ahead was blocked with a line of cars and tractors, their engines running and their drivers&#x2019; heads poking from windows. Some were out of their cars, looking at the road that led to St. Denis. Several were talking urgently into cell phones. In the distance a car horn sounded, swiftly joined by others in discordant chorus. As Bruno surveyed the scene his own phone began to ring. He checked the screen, recognized the name of Pierre, a neighbor who lived farther up the road. He ignored it, assuming Pierre would be calling to complain at being stuck in the jam ahead. There had to be an accident of some sort.<br><br>Bruno pushed aside the thought that he could have avoided this delay if he&#x2019;d stayed the night with Pamela, the English-woman he&#x2019;d been seeing since the autumn. She had called off the arrangement that he would dine with her and stay the night, saying she&#x2019;d finally secured an early morning appointment with the <i>marï¿½chal</i>, the traveling farrier who was to reshoe her horses. Pamela postponed their meetings too frequently for Bruno&#x2019;s comfort, and he was never quite sure whether she was cooling on their relationship or simply wary of commitment. They were to meet again that evening, he reminded himself, without feeling greatly reassured. He parked the van and climbed out to investigate. The best view of the long traffic jam was commanded by Alain, who kept a dairy farm farther up the road to Les Eyzies.<br><br>&#x201c;Geese&#x2014;ï¿½the road&#x2019;s full of ducks and geese,&#x201d; he called down to Bruno from his perch high on a tractor. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all over the place.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno heard the sound of rival honking as the geese called back in response to the car horns, and he quickly clambered up beside Alain to peer ahead. The traffic jam stretched as far up the road as he could see. Darting between the stalled cars were perhaps hundreds of ducks and geese, streaming through the woods on the side of the road and heading across it to settle in a broad pond that spread across the meadow, swollen by the spring rains.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Louis Villatte&#x2019;s farm, behind those woods,&#x201d; said Alain. &#x201c;A tree must have come down and broken his fence, let them all escape. There&#x2019;s over three thousand birds in there. Or rather, there used to be. Looks like he&#x2019;s lost a few to the cars too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you got his number?&#x201d; Bruno asked. Alain nodded. &#x201c;Call him, see if he knows his birds have escaped. Then go through those woods and see if you can help Louis block the gap in his fence. I&#x2019;ll try and sort this out here. Join you later.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno went back to his van, released Gigi, and walked with him down the road, brushing aside the drivers&#x2019; angry queries. A driver he knew was looking mournfully at a broken headlamp while a wounded goose lay half pinned under his car, honking feebly.<br><br>&#x201c;You grew up on a farm, Pierre,&#x201d; Bruno told him, rushing past. &#x201c;Put the poor devil out of its misery.&#x201d; Looking back, he saw Pierre bend to grip the goose behind its head and twist. The bird fluttered wildly and then went limp. Even when the farm boy grew up like Pierre to work in an accountant&#x2019;s office, he hadn&#x2019;t lost the skill.<br><br>When he came to the main grouping of birds, advancing in a jumbled column from the woods, Bruno saw that the road ahead was blocked by some stalled cars coming the other way. He briefly considered using Gigi to turn the birds back, but they would go off and cross the road elsewhere. There was no stopping this exodus, so he might as well try to speed it up and clear the road. He persuaded the leading cars in each queue to reverse a little to make a broader passage to let the birds pass freely across to the pond. Some drivers tried to argue, but he pointed out that the sooner he could stop the supply of ducks, the sooner the road would unblock. He left them grumbling and took Gigi into the trees, trotting past the trail of ducks and geese that was still pottering and waddling its way from the Villatte farm. Bruno smiled to himself, wondering if the birds felt a sense of escape or curiosity, of adventure triggered by the coming of springtime.<br><br>Louis and his wife were already at the huge hole torn in the fence. No tree had fallen, no tractor had ridden through the sturdy barrier of wooden posts and chicken wire that ringed the farm. Instead, whole fence posts had been hauled from the earth and the wire cut. With boards and old doors and cardboard boxes stuffed beneath an ancient tractor, Louis was trying to plug the gaps in the fence. His wife and eldest son were flapping their arms, and their dog was barking to shoo away the ducks and geese following their fellows toward the freedom of the woods.<br><br>Without being told, Gigi darted forward to help drive the birds back from the fence, and Bruno helped Alain to haul some branches from broken trees to seal the remaining gaps in the wire. Once the makeshift barrier was in place, Louis came forward to shake their hands. Gigi and Louis&#x2019;s dog sniffed politely at each other&#x2019;s tails and then sat beside each other, staring at any bird daring to approach.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been at this since daybreak,&#x201d; Louis said. &#x201c;You see how big this gap is? Some bastard ripped this fence down deliberately and did a good job of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we know who,&#x201d; added Sandrine, his wife. &#x201c;Look at this, stuck on the bits of the fence they didn&#x2019;t tear down.&#x201d; She handed Bruno a photocopied leaflet, sealed inside a transparent plastic envelope.<br><br>&#x201c;STOP cruelty to animals. Boycott foie gras,&#x201d; he read. There was a smudged photocopied image of a duck held down in a narrow cage. A flexible tube hanging from above was thrust into its mouth by an unidentified man who was stretching the duck&#x2019;s neck taut for the force-ï¿½feeding. At the bottom, it read &#x201c;<i>Contactez</i> <i>PETAFrance.com</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this PETA?&#x201d; asked Alain, peering over Bruno&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an American thing, maybe British, but it&#x2019;s growing in France. They made a big fuss up in Paris about battery chickens and veal, those calves kept in pens. Looks like they&#x2019;ve started running a campaign against foie gras.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s our livelihood,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;And we don&#x2019;t make foie gras, we just raise the birds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And look at this,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;The wire&#x2019;s been cut with proper cutters. This was organized.&#x201d; He showed Bruno the snipped strands of wire. &#x201c;Then they pulled it away somewhere, hiding the stretches of wire they cut. I sent the other boy out looking for it in the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;City bastards,&#x201d; grunted Alain. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know the first thing about the country and they come here like a bunch of terrorists and try to ruin people.&#x201d; He turned aside and spat. &#x201c;You find out who they are, Bruno, and we&#x2019;ll take care of the rest.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno ignored Alain&#x2019;s outrage on behalf of his fellow farmer. &#x201c;All the birds seem to be heading for that pond on the far side of the road,&#x201d; he told Louis. &#x201c;Have you got some way to round them up and bring them back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ring the food bell. That brings most of them running. And for the rest, I&#x2019;ve got some netting. That&#x2019;s how we usually round them up. I&#x2019;ll put them in the trailer and bring them back once I&#x2019;ve got this fence fixed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sooner the better, because they&#x2019;ve blocked the whole road into town,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what brought me here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Crazy birds,&#x201d; said Louis, grimacing in rueful affection. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got a perfectly good pond back in the field, but give them a sniff of someplace new and off they go.&#x201d; He gestured back beyond his house where already some of the ducks, frustrated at their efforts to escape through the newly sealed barrier, were splashing and paddling serenely in their old familiar pond.<br><br>A young boy of about ten labored toward them from the woods, proudly hauling a section of wire fence.<br><br>&#x201c;I found it, Papa,&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s more. I can show you where.&#x201d; His face broke into a grin at seeing Bruno, who taught him to play rugby in winter and tennis in summer. &#x201c;Bonjour, Monsieur Bruno.&#x201d; He dropped the fence and came forward to shake hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Bonjour, Daniel. Did you see or hear anything when this happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. The first I heard was when Papa woke us all up to come out and save the birds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard something, a duck call, a single one and then repeated, just before the cockerel started,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;So it must have been a bit before dawn. I remember thinking that&#x2019;s odd, because the ducks don&#x2019;t usually stir until after the hens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could it have been a lure, one of those hunter&#x2019;s calls?&#x201d; Bruno asked. &#x201c;Whoever cut the fence must have had some way to wake the birds and tempt them to move. They&#x2019;d have wanted them out before you and the family were awake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must have been something like that,&#x201d; Sandrine said. &#x201c;The birds tend to stick around the barn, waiting to be fed. They&#x2019;ve never gone off before, even when we had that storm that knocked part of the fence down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get back to the road and see that jam is cleared,&#x201d; said Bruno.<br><br>&#x201c;Before you go, what do you know about this PETA?&#x201d; asked Sandrine.<br><br>&#x201c;Not a lot, but I&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; Bruno replied. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve lost one or two birds to the cars, but not many.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those birds are worth six euros each to us,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t afford to lose any of them, what with the bank loan we have to pay until we sell this lot. What if those PETA people come again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll shoot the bastards,&#x201d; Louis said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take turns keeping watch, sit up all night if we have to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a right to protect your property with reasonable force, according to the law,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;But people interpret &#x2018;reasonable force&#x2019; in different ways. If you hear anything happening again, it&#x2019;s best you call me. Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t use a firearm or any kind of weapon. The best thing is to photograph them so we can identify who they are. If you have any lights you can rig up, or one of those motion detectors . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A camera won&#x2019;t do any good,&#x201d; said Alain. &#x201c;Even with photos the damn courts will take their side. They&#x2019;re all mad Greenies, the magistrates. Then there&#x2019;s those food inspectors and all the other rules and regulations, tying us up in knots.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I know who it is,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s those students at the archaeology site who came in last week, working on some dig with that German professor, over toward Campagne. They&#x2019;re all staying at the municipal campground. This time of year, they&#x2019;re the only strangers around here and you know what those students are like. They&#x2019;re all Greens now.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll check it out. See you later.&#x201d; Along the fence he saw the fluttering of another of the leaflets inside a plastic bag, one of the kind that could be sealed and used in freezers. He took out a handkerchief and gingerly removed the pins that held it to the wire. Forensics might get something from it. There were several more attached along the fence and he took another. He nodded at Alain. &#x201c;Do you want to come with me? You&#x2019;ll have to move your tractor.&#x201d;<br><br>As he reached the road, where the jam was steadily clearing itself, Bruno&#x2019;s phone rang again. He checked the screen, saw the name &#x201c;Horst,&#x201d; and this time he answered. Horst Vogelstern was the German professor of archaeology in charge of the student volunteers at the dig. For more than twenty years Horst had spent his vacations at a small house he owned on the outskirts of St. Denis. He ran digs in the Vï¿½zï¿½re Valley that the local tourist board liked to proclaim as the cradle of prehistoric man. The first site of Cro-ï¿½Magnon man had been found in the valley over a hundred years earlier, and the famous cave paintings of Lascaux were farther up the river. It was a source of pride to Bruno that he lived in this valley that could claim the longest continuous human habitation of anywhere on earth.<br><br>Bruno had attended a couple of Horst&#x2019;s lectures, delivered in excellent if strongly accented French. He had visited his digs and read a couple of articles Horst had published in the popular monthly <i>Dossiers d&#x2019;Archï¿½ologie</i>. Normally a quiet man, Horst became passionate when he talked of his subject, the great mystery of the replacement of the Neanderthals by the Cro-ï¿½Magnons some thirty thousand years ago. Had it been violent? Did they interbreed? Were the Neanderthals wiped out by some plague or disease? It was, said Horst, the crucial question regarding our human origins. Whenever Horst spoke, Bruno caught a sense of the excitement that gripped the scholar.<br><br>&#x201c;Horst,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;How are you? I was just on my way to see you at the dig.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good, we need you here right away. And you had better bring a doctor with you. We&#x2019;ve found a body.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Congratulations. Isn&#x2019;t that what you wanted to find?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, but I want skeletons from the distant past. This one is wearing a St. Christopher medal around his neck and I think he&#x2019;s also wearing a Swatch. This is your department, Bruno, not mine.&#x201d;</p><h2>Toliver&#39;s Secret</h2><p>When her grandfather is injured, 10-year-old Ellen Toliver replaces him on a<br>top-secret patriotic mission.

The discoveries made at this site, now the modern town of Luxor, are responsible for much of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilization. After excavating and researching the city of Thebes for many years, Nigel and Helen Strudwick here offer the first comprehensive introduction to it, one that will be welcomed by both armchair travelers and visitors to that popular tourist destination. Handsomely illustrated, the book features eighty photographs&#x2015;thirty in color&#x2015;and twenty maps and plans.</p><p>After reviewing the topography of the site, the Strudwicks recount the history of Thebes from the city's rise in the late Old Kingdom to the peak of its power in the New Kingdom and to its gradual decline in the Greco-Roman period. They discuss the central role played by the gods in the community's religious life, and take us on a tour of the great temples of Karnak and Luxor on the East Bank of the Nile and of the temples and tombs of kings, queens, princes, and ordinary individuals on the West Bank.</p><p>Drawing on their intimate acquaintance with ancient Egyptian society, the authors re-create the lives of Thebans during the New Kingdom. They conclude by assessing Greek, Roman, Coptic, and Islamic influences on the area as it exists today and by providing an overview of the archaeological research undertaken there.</p></p><p><p>NIGEL STRUDWICK is an Egyptologist at the University of Cambridge. He and HELEN STRUDWICK have been working at Luxor, mainly in the Tombs of the Nobles, for over twelve years. Most recently Nigel Strudwick was a visiting fellow at the Egyptian Institute at the University of Heidelberg. Frequent lecturers, the Strudwicks have both written extensively on the site and topics related to it.</p>"The authors provide detailed and accurate information about life in the city. This is an excellent, recommended, must-read book for all."&#x2015;Frankie's Reviews in Egyptology<br><br>"The authors bring together their extensive collective knowledge and experience with both ancient Waset (Thebes) and modern Luxor to create in this volume what qualifies as the best comprehensive general study to date of arguably the single most important site in all of Egypt, archeologically speaking. . . This is a work that should not go ignored."&#x2015;KMT, Winter 1999-2000.<br><br>"Nigel and Helen Strudwick have provided the first comprehensive treatment of the most important archaeological site in Egypt. No other location, with the possible exception of Saqqara, has yielded material from all the major epochs of Egyptian history. Clearly written and well organized, the book presents valuable new information about its subject."&#x2015;James F.

He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an under employment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something could be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decision, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment ABOUT THE AUTHOR:- John Maynard Keynes (5 June 1883- 21 April 1946) was a British economist and professor at Cambridge. He was a prolific author and lecturer and advised many governments and policy makers on economic policy. At the 1944, Bretton woods conference, where the International Monetary Fund was established, Keynes was one of the architects of the post war system of fixed exchange rates. Contrary to some of his critics assertion, Keynes was a relatively strong advocate of free markets. The author believed that once full employment had been achieved by Fiscal Policy measures, the market mechanism could then operate freely. His selected works are: Indian Currency and Finance; The Economic consequences of the peace; A Tract of Monetary Reform; The Economic consequences of Mr. Churchill; A Treatise of money CONTENTS:- BOOK I CHAPTER 1 THE GENERAL THEORY (3) CHAPTER 2 THE POSTULATES OF THE CLASSICAL ECONOMICS (4) CHAPTER 3 THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE DEMAND (23) BOOK II Definitions and Ideas CHAPTER 4 THE CHOICE OF UNITS (37) CHAPTER 5 EXPECTATION AS DETERMINING OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT (46) CHAPTER 6 THE DEFINITION OF INCOME, SAVING AND INVESTM</p><p></p><h2>I Married a Dead Man (Crime, Penguin)</h2><p>Helen, pregnant and single, allows the parents of an acquaintance to believe that she is their dead son&#39;s wife, but her former lover finds out and begins blackmailing her</p><p></p><h2>My Country and My People</h2><p>Lin Yutang, one of the most well-known Chinese philosophers and writers in 1930&#39;s, lived mainly in the U.S since 1928.

Nolan has mastered the soldier&#39;s slang and weaves it expertly into the account...full of combat anecdotes detailing battlefield leadership successes and failures.--Military Review</p><p>Based on interviews, letters and diaries, this fourth book by Nolan ( The Battle for Hue ) on the war in Vietnam gives a vivid account of the U.S. Army's role in the 1970 attack on Cambodia, disregarding, with good reason, involvement of South Vietnamese forces in the mission: although the ARVN inflicted more casualties against the North Vietnamese and Vietcong than did American troops, no records evidently exist of their wartime operations. Despite many examples in these pages of exemplary leadership and sacrifice, the author's chief feat is to depict candidly the progressive demoralization of Americans during the campaign. He deals with painful realities that, he argues, divided the ranks: the GI drug problem and influence of the Black Power movement on the army; conflicts between sometimes reluctant draftees and stalwart "career" personnel; and the issue of "combat refusal." Nolan does not skimp on details of military action, all of it taking place during a phase of the war when the principal goal for soldiers, as he sees it, was survival--not destruction of the enemy--and concludes that the two-month campaign was a tactical success of limited value to the war as a whole. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Food As Medicine Everyday: Reclaim Your Health With Whole Foods</h2><p><p>"Food as medicine" is a powerful approach to health and healing, intimately woven into naturopathic medical education.

The concept is good. Michelangelo, as an old and enfeebled sculptor, remembers the past and recounts the circumstances in which he created his most famous works: the Pieta, the statue of David, the tombs of Julius II and the Medici princes, the painting of the Sistine chapel, and the plans for St. Peter's cathedral dome. Unfortunately, neither text nor illustrations offer much insight into the personality and character of the artist. Further, there is a feeling of discrepancy between the even-toned, fact-based narrative and the lighthearted, miniatured drawings filled with comic detail. In many instances it is difficult to see what part of the text is being illustrated, and even more difficult to identify the figure of Michelangelo in the crowded group scenes. Despite its disappointing features, Ventura's pictures do make this an attractive volume, and it should be a good purchase for the art shelf. A chronology of Michelangelo's life and a photographic display of his principal works in the last pages add to the usefulness of this informational picture book for older children. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, N.J.

An elderly woman loves to read so she moves to the Australian countryside for peace and quiet and more leisure time. But each season brings its chore or emergency with little time to spare, until the deepest heart of winter. The detailed watercolors abound with animals, from lizards and mice to koalas and kangaroos. Books are everywhere, stacked by the fireplace, tucked into a pocket, piled by a chair. The minimal narrative is expanded by the illustrations. The text says, "In spring she had an unexpected visitor who was very demanding"; the picture shows the woman bottle-feeding a stray lamb while trying to read. During the hot dry summer she pumps water for her menagerie and is menaced by a brush fire. When the autumn rains swell the river, she floats in a Noah's Ark of a bathtub. Winch adds interest by using a variety of perspectives?a lamb's eye view of the old woman's work-booted feet, a close-up of her face peering through the leaves as she picks fruit. A long-distance view of the lonely cabin during winter is contrasted with a picture of a cozy interior and the old woman surrounded by books and animals. When she finally has time to read, she is so exhausted that she dozes over her book, but her love of reading and the idea that books are an integral part of life comes through.?Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 3^-6. An old woman moves to the country seeking the time and quiet she craves to read. Instead, she finds a tumbledown farm and attendant chores. It's a simple story line that finds rich and humorous embellishment in Winch's engagingly detailed watercolors. This old lady is far from sedentary; among the books and baggage she carts to the farm are golf clubs and a field hockey stick. These she resourcefully turns into fence posts as she repairs the farm. A menagerie of Australian animals share her life and steal scenes as parrots peek between pear-tree branches, mice scurry through the house, and a pig and a platypus luxuriate in a trough of water during the blistering summer heat, which erupts into terrifying flames. Next, the animals and the old woman crowd into a rusty bathtub to escape the fall's floods, and, finally, with winter comes the calm she seeks and the time, surrounded by her animals and books, to relax--and take a well-earned nap. Youngsters will laugh out loud at the animals' antics and the old woman's desperate attempts to read. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>All Shall Be Well: The Spirituality of Julian of Norwich for Today</h2><p>&#34;In some of the later chapters I have briefly explored the way of contemplative prayer based on the Dionysian tradition and developed in The cloud of unknowing&#34;--Pref.</p><p></p><h2>Winds of Fury (Mage Winds, Bk. 3)</h2><p>In the epic conclusion of the Mage Winds trilogy, Princess Elspeth the Herald and her partner, Tayledras adept Darkwind, return to Valdemar to confront the evil that is threatening her homeland.</p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b> is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling <b>Heralds Of Valdemar</b> series.

Wodehouse published over ninety books in his seventy-year career. Born in in 1881 in Surrey, England, he came a U.S. citizen in 1955. He died at the age of 93 in 1975.1<br><br>THE SMILE THAT WINS<br><br>The conversation in the bar-parlour of the Angler's Rest had turned to the subject of the regrettably low standard of morality prevalent among the nobility and landed gentry of Great Britain.<br><br>Miss Postlethwaite, our erudite barmaid, had brought the matter up by mentioning that in the novelette which she was reading a viscount had just thrown a family solicitor over a cliff.<br><br>'Because he had found out his guilty secret,' explained Miss Postlethwaite, polishing a glass a little severely, for she was a good woman. 'It was his guilty secret this solicitor had found out, so the viscount threw him over a cliff. I suppose, if one did but know, that sort of thing is going on all the time.'<br><br>Mr Mulliner nodded gravely.<br><br>'So much so,' he agreed, 'that I believe that whenever a family solicitor is found in two or more pieces at the bottom of a cliff, the first thing the Big Four at Scotland Yard do is make a roundup of all the viscounts in the neighbourhood.'<br><br>'Baronets are worse than viscounts,' said a Pint of Stout vehemently. 'I was done down by one only last month over the sale of a cow.'<br><br>'Earls are worse than baronets,' insisted a Whisky Sour. 'I could tell you something about earls.'<br><br>'How about O.B.E.s?' demanded a Mild and Bitter. 'If you ask me, O.B.E.s want watching, too.'<br><br>Mr Mulliner sighed.<br><br>'The fact is,' he said, 'reluctant though one may be to admit it, the entire British aristocracy is seamed and honeycombed with immorality. I venture to assert that, if you took a pin and jabbed it down anywhere in the pages of <i>Debrett's Peerage</i>, you would find it piercing the name of someone who was going about the place with a conscience as tender as a sunburned neck. If anything were needed to prove my assertion, the story of my nephew, Adrian Mulliner, the detective, would do it.'<br><br>'I didn't know you had a nephew who was a detective,' said the Whisky Sour.<br>Oh, yes. He has retired now, but at one time he was as keen an operator as anyone in the profession (said Mr Mulliner). After leaving Oxford and trying his hand at one or two uncongenial tasks, he had found his niche as a member of the firm of Widgery and Boon, Investigators, of Albemarle Street. And it was during his second year with this old-established house that he met and loved Lady Millicent Shipton-Bellinger, younger daughter of the fifth Earl of Brangbolton.<br><br>It was the Adventure of the Missing Sealyham that brought the young couple together. From the purely professional standpoint, my nephew has never ranked this among his greatest triumphs of ratiocination; but, considering what it led to, he might well, I think, be justified in regarding it as the most important case of his career. What happened was that he met the animal straying in the park, deduced from the name and address on its collar that it belonged to Lady Millicent Shipton-Bellinger, of 18a, Upper Brook Street, and took it thither at the conclusion of his stroll and restored it.<br><br>'Child's-play' is the phrase with which, if you happen to allude to it, Adrian Mulliner will always airily dismiss this particular investigation; but Lady Millicent could not have displayed more admiration and enthusiasm had it been the supremest masterpiece of detective work. She fawned on my nephew. She invited him in to tea, consisting of buttered toast, anchovy sandwiches and two kinds of cake; and at the conclusion of the meal they parted on terms which, even at that early stage in their acquaintance, were something warmer than those of mere friendship.<br><br>Indeed, it is my belief that the girl fell in love with Adrian as instantaneously as he with her. On him, it was her radiant blonde beauty that exercised the spell. She, on her side, was fascinated, I fancy, not only by the regularity of his features, which, as is the case with all the Mulliners, was considerable, but also by the fact that he was dark and thin and wore an air of inscrutable melancholy.<br><br>This, as a matter of fact, was due to the troublesome attacks of dyspepsia from which he had suffered since boyhood; but to the girl it naturally seemed evidence of a great and romantic soul. Nobody, she felt, could look so grave and sad, had he not hidden deeps in him.<br><br>One can see the thing from her point of view. All her life she had been accustomed to brainless juveniles who eked out their meagre eyesight with monocles and, as far as conversation was concerned, were a spent force after they had asked her if she had seen the Academy or did she think she would prefer a glass of lemonade. The effect on her of a dark, keen-eyed man like Adrian Mulliner, who spoke well and easily of footprints, psychology and the underworld, must have been stupendous.<br><br>At any rate, their love ripened rapidly. It could not have been two weeks after their first meeting when Adrian, as he was giving her lunch one day at the Senior Bloodstain, the detectives' club in Rupert Street, proposed and was accepted. And for the next twenty-four hours, one is safe in saying, there was in the whole of London, including the outlying suburban districts, no happier private investigator than he.<br><br>Next day, however, when he again met Millicent for lunch, he was disturbed to perceive on her beautiful face an emotion which his trained eye immediately recognized as anguish.<br><br>'Oh, Adrian,' said the girl brokenly. 'The worst has happened. My father refuses to hear of our marrying. When I told him we were engaged, he said "Pooh!" quite a number of times, and added that he had never heard such dashed nonsense in his life. You see, ever since my Uncle Joe's trouble in nineteen-twenty-eight, father has had a horror of detectives.'<br><br>'I don't think I have met your Uncle Joe.'<br><br>'You will have the opportunity next year. With the usual allowance for good conduct he should be with us again about July. And there is another thing.'<br><br>'Not another?'<br><br>'Yes. Do you know Sir Jasper Addleton, O.B.E.?'<br><br>'The financier?'<br><br>'Father wants me to marry him. Isn't it awful!'<br><br>'I have certainly heard more enjoyable bits of news,' agreed Adrian. 'This wants a good deal of careful thinking over.'<br><br>The process of thinking over his unfortunate situation had the effect of rendering excessively acute the pangs of Adrian Mulliner's dyspepsia. During the past two weeks the ecstasy of being with Millicent and deducing that she loved him had caused a complete cessation of the attacks; but now they began again, worse than ever. At length, after a sleepless night during which he experienced all the emotions of one who has carelessly swallowed a family of scorpions, he sought a specialist.<br><br>The specialist was one of those keen, modern minds who disdain the outworn formulï¿½ of the more conservative mass of the medical profession. He examined Adrian carefully, then sat back in his chair, with the tips of his fingers touching.<br><br>'Smile!' he said.<br><br>'Eh?' said Adrian.<br><br>'Smile, Mr Mulliner.'<br><br>'Did you say smile?'<br><br>'That's it. Smile.'<br><br>'But,' Adrian pointed out, 'I've just lost the only girl I ever loved.'<br><br>'Well, that's fine,' said the specialist, who was a bachelor. 'Come on, now, if you please. Start smiling.'<br><br>Adrian was a little bewildered. 'Listen,' he said. 'What <i>is</i> all this about smiling? We started, if I recollect, talking about my gastric juices. Now, in some mysterious way, we seem to have got on to the subject of smiles. How do you mean -- smile? I never smile. I haven't smiled since the butler tripped over the spaniel and upset the melted butter on my Aunt Elizabeth, when I was a boy of twelve.'<br><br>The specialist nodded.<br><br>'Precisely. And that is why your digestive organs trouble you. Dyspepsia,' he proceeded, 'is now recognized by the progressive element of the profession as purely mental. We do not treat it with drugs and medicines. Happiness is the only cure. Be gay, Mr Mulliner. Be cheerful. And, if you can't do that, at any rate smile. The mere exercise of the risible muscles is in itself beneficial. Go out now and make a point, whenever you have a spare moment, of smiling.'<br><br>'Like this?' said Adrian.<br><br>'Wider than that.'<br><br>'How about this?'<br><br>'Better,' said the specialist, 'but still not quite so elastic as one could desire. Naturally, you need practice. We must expect the muscles to work rustily for a while at their unaccustomed task. No doubt things will brighten by and by.'<br><br>He regarded Adrian thoughtfully.<br><br>'Odd,' he said. 'A curious smile, yours, Mr Mulliner. It reminds me a little of the Mona Lisa's. It has the same underlying note of the sardonic and the sinister. It virtually amounts to a leer. Somehow it seems to convey the suggestion that you know all. Fortunately, my own life is an open book, for all to read, and so I was not discommoded. But I think it would be better if, for the present, you endeavoured not to smile at invalids or nervous persons. Good morning, Mr Mulliner. That will be five guineas, precisely.'<br>On Adrian's face, as he went off that afternoon to perform the duties assigned to him by his firm, there was no smile of any description. He shrank from the ordeal before him. He had been told off to guard the wedding-presents at a reception in Grosvenor Square, and naturally anything to do with weddings was like a sword through his heart. His face, as he patrolled the room where the gifts were laid out, was drawn and forbidding. Hitherto, at these functions, it had always been his pride that nobody could tell that he was a detective. To-day, a child could have recognized his trade. He looked like Sherlock Holmes.<br><br>To the gay throng that surged about him he paid little attention. Usually tense and alert on occasions like this, he now found his mind wandering. He mused sadly on Millicent. And suddenly -- the result, no doubt, of these gloomy meditations, though a glass of wedding champagne may have contributed its mite -- there shot through him, starting at about the third button of his neat waistcoat, a pang ...</p><h2>Own Your Game: How to Use Your Mind to Play Winning Golf</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The Pro Tour&#x2019;s hottest coach&#x201d; (<i>Golf Digest</i>) distills the lessons of a private strategy session into an indispensable &#x201c;soft skills&#x201d; companion. </b><br>&nbsp;<br>Credited with transforming the short games of world-class golfers like Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Annika Sorenstam, and Yani Tseng, Dave Stockton is one of the most sought-after coaches in golf.

Scarred, scared, and pretending to be someone else, she's trying to find a reason to go on living after the murder of her lover and her own close call with death (<i>Hunter's Moon</i>). Her self-imposed exile is threatened when Chopper Jim Chopin, a state trooper from her home village in the Bush, arrives in Bering with a new identity of his own. Tagging along are a couple of (barely) undercover FBI agents who think that criminals aboard a Russian fishing vessel docked in Bering's harbor are attempting to smuggle stolen plutonium into the United States to sell to terrorists. But Kate suspects that the Russians are involved in a very different game: laundering money through a local bank. To prove it, she enlists the help of an old college friend who happens to be the bank's chief teller. But getting the evidence costs Alice Chevak dearly; once again, Kate fears, she's brought death to someone she loves. <p> In this ninth outing for her popular series heroine, Dana Stabenow adds depth, texture, and vulnerability to Kate's inner life; reveals new aspects of Jim Chopin's character; and introduces Alice's daughter Stephanie, with whom Kate forges a bond of love and obligation that promises the youngster an ongoing role in future Kate Shugak's adventures.

It captures the reasons that he and his peers excelled so outstandingly during World War II and why they continued to do so during their lifetimes. The memoir takes you through the life and times of Robinson in a manner that reveals his character and accomplishments as a Tuskegee Airman, and beyond, while providing insights into how he managed the challenges of his era. Not only does he have a remarkable and fascinating history that he tells, but he is the descendant of a family of high achievers that he traces to the 1730s, with five previous generations on American soil. His family story depicts without rancor or judgment shameful aspects of American history and the amazing struggles and achievements of an African-American family. Mr. Robinson had family members who worked on the congressional campaign of Congressman Robert Smalls in 1876, and is the son of a family that produced three military officers during World War II he plus two his older brothers - a record for World War II. His story is a personal, informative, insightful and entertaining view into the origins of an African American middle class family that distinguished itself during World War II and established itself during Reconstruction.</p><p>George Norfleet is an author and publisher based in Washington, DC. He spent 23 years as a telecommunications economic and financial analyst, and network planner. In July of 2003 he began a series of taped interviews with the late Curtis C.

Instead, he argues that it is better described as &#34;ages of dawn,&#34; for it is in this rich and confused period that the complex and creative interaction of the Roman empire, the Christian Church, the classical tradition, and barbarous societies provided the foundation for a vital, unified European culture. In an age of fragmentation and the emergence of new nationalist forces, Dawson argued that if &#34;our civilization is to survive, it is essential that it should develop a common European consciousness and sense of historic and organic unity.&#34; But he was clear that this unity required sources deeper and more complex than the political and economic</p><p></p><h2>Mystery Cats III: More Feline Felonies</h2><p>A collection of feline mystery fables features Lilian Jackson Braun&#39;s clever Siamese, Phut Phat; Edward D.

In the name of security, Executive Order 9066 allowed for the summary removal of Japanese aliens and American citizens of Japanese descent from their West Coast homes and their incarceration under guard in camps. Amid the numerous histories and memoirs devoted to this shameful event, FDR's contributions have been seen as negligible. Now, using Roosevelt's own writings, his advisors' letters and diaries, and internal government documents, Greg Robinson reveals the president's central role in making and implementing the internment and examines not only what the president did but why. <p></p><p> Robinson traces FDR's outlook back to his formative years, and to the early twentieth century's racialist view of ethnic Japanese in America as immutably "foreign" and threatening. These prejudicial sentiments, along with his constitutional philosophy and leadership style, contributed to Roosevelt's approval of the unprecedented mistreatment of American citizens. His hands-on participation and interventions were critical in determining the nature, duration, and consequences of the administration's internment policy. </p><p> <i>By Order of the President</i> attempts to explain how a great humanitarian leader and his advisors, who were fighting a war to preserve democracy, could have implemented such a profoundly unjust and undemocratic policy toward their own people. It reminds us of the power of a president's beliefs to influence and determine public policy and of the need for citizen vigilance to protect the rights of all against potential abuses.</p></p><p><b>Greg Robinson</b> is Assistant Professor of History, Universitï¿½ du Quï¿½bec ï¿½ Montrï¿½al.Robinson...focuses on one aspect of Roosevelt's presidency during World War II, the internment of Japanese Americans. Two recent books, Kenneth S. Davis's <i>FDR: The War President, 1940-43</i>...and Thomas Fleming's <i>The New Dealers' War: F.D.R. and the War within World War II</i>...only briefly mention the internment. Using memos, reports, diary entries, letters, and other documents written by FDR and his staff, this book offers the first in-depth look at the role of Roosevelt and his advisers in making the decision to intern. While racist attitudes were widespread and many people influenced the final decision to issue Executive Order 9066, Robinson also cites Roosevelt's long-held belief that the Japanese were innately different and therefore did not deserve citizenship. This refusal to accept them as citizens along with considerable war hysteria allowed him to strip them of their rights for the duration of the war. The book sheds some light on a dark episode in our history. (Katharine L. Kan <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>A thorough, scholarly, and troubling analysis of FDR's decision in the early days of WWII to hold in internment camps more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans...According to Robinson, FDR viewed Japanese-Americans as Japanese first, American second. Despite virulent rumors to the contrary, there was no sabotage of US facilities by Japanese-Americans (as J. Edgar Hoover repeatedly informed FDR), but wartime paranoia (especially after Pearl Harbor) soon held sway. The author also believes political pressures from the West Coast influenced FDR, as did his unenlightened racial views (views not shared by his wife, who crusaded for the release of those interned). The president seems to have been uninterested in hearing contrary opinions--even when his principal advisers were urging him to rescind Executive Order 9066, the internment authorization, which he signed on February 19, 1942. It wasn't until late summer of 1944 that the releases began. Splendid scholarship shines a harsh light on one of the darkest episodes in American history. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>What Greg Robinson shows, in this careful and fair-minded study, is that Roosevelt himself, far from being the scourge of racism portrayed in New-Deal hagiography, had a long history of racial prejudice against the Japanese, which had been exacerbated by the Japanese attack on China...Robinson indulges Roosevelt somewhat when he absolves him of the charge of racism, and convicts him only of a blend of weak administration and deadly indifference, which, he says, was informed by racial hostility but not synonymous with it. (<i>The Economist</i> 2001-09-22)<br><br>Greg Robinson's <i>By Order of the President</i> provides a thoughtful analysis and adapts a psycho-historical approach to help unlock the clues to an ostensibly inexplicable act by FDR, an ardent defender of human liberty. By delving first into FDR's early years, Robinson proceeds to other experiences that may have shaped his thinking and led FDR to ultimately ink Executive Order 9066...In the end, with his lucid writing style, Robinson's gift is an ability to cogently present the dilemmas of the time and show how FDR erred: "Two closely interrelated elements stand out strongly as determinative in the President's decision and his subsequent actions. One of these was undoubtedly Roosevelt's own negative beliefs about Japanese Americans, while the other was a failure of political and moral leadership that resulted from weaknesses in his presidential style and administrative organization." This analysis is particularly thought-provoking in light of recent events, and it echoes George Santayana's warning for those who forget history. (Mark T. Fung <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> 2001-10-04)<br><br>In this lucid, comprehensive and balanced examination, Robinson maintains that Roosevelt's decision was, in fact, "not fundamentally inconsistent with his overall political philosophy and world view." Rather, a deep-seated belief that Japanese-Americans were biologically "incapable of being true Americans" enabled FDR, though he "deplored open prejudice," to be "willingly misled" by bad counsel and misinformation about the perceived Japanese-American threat, despite reliable reports, including one by J. Edgar Hoover, to the contrary...Robinson's conscientious arguments and meticulous documentation movingly clarify a little-understood failure of American democracy. (Charlotte Sheedy <i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2001-09-24)<br><br><i>By Order of the President</i> by Greg Robinson is a harsh but well-documented indictment of a great president, Franklin Roosevelt, for moral and administrative failures in "the most tragic act of his administration." The book's strength is that it doesn't excuse Roosevelt, but places his actions in the context of their times and his background. Long before Pearl Harbor, racist views of Asians were widely accepted. (Bob Minzesheimer <i>USA Today</i> 2001-10-23)<br><br><i>By Order of the President</i> is a fascinating and powerful examination of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's involvement in (and responsibility for) the military orders that led to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Lucidly organized, well written, fair minded, and extensively researched, Greg Robinson's work was a pleasure to read. (David C. Lundsgaard <i>Find Law's Book Reviews</i> 2001-10-26)<br><br>Robinson argues persuasively that Roosevelt, who shared the anti-Japanese prejudices of his age and class, played a vital role, sometimes actively, more often passively, in the sorry affair. He went along with the War Department and west coast politicians who favoured internment; took very little interest in the way that the policy was carried out and failed to take a lead in bringing the policy to an early end or in defending Japanese-Americans against the charge of disloyalty at a time when only he could offer such a lead. The very qualities, Robinson suggests, that made Roosevelt a great president--his pragmatism, devotion to compromise and interest in results--in this instance proved disastrous. This is a thorough, persuasive and, as it turned out, extremely timely book. (Ben Rogers <i>Financial Times</i> 2001-12-01)<br><br>An outstanding new book by historian Greg Robinson...<i>By Order of the President</i>...revisits this disturbing period and the President's role in it...Robinson sees a complex intersection of economic and social forces behind the President's decision to intern Japanese-Americans. Feeding these forces was racism...The author avoids the trap of branding FDR as an out-and-out racist. Instead, his portrait of Roosevelt is carefully nuanced...This is an extremely valuable book. It is well written, balanced--and disturbing. (S. Scott Rohrer <i>National Journal</i> 2001-12-08)<br><br>Robinson focuses not on the internees but on the president who signed Executive Order 9066 that put them in internment camps. If internment is now seen as a blot on the Roosevelt era, the president himself has generally been viewed as above the fray. Robinson's judicious exploration of the record shows that Roosevelt was, in fact, deeply involved, his racial attitudes helping to determine the fates of nearly 120,000 Japanese American internees.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country had an opportunity to face its tortured past. In <em>Inside the Stalin Archives</em>, Jonathan Brent asks, why didn't this happen? Why are the anti-Semitic Protocols of Zion sold openly in the lobby of the State Duma? Why are archivists under surveillance and phones still tapped? Why does Stalin, a man responsible for the deaths of millions of his own people, remain popular enough to appear on boxes of chocolate sold in Moscow's airport?<br> <br> Brent draws on fifteen years of unprecedented access to high-level Soviet Archives to answer these questions. He shows us a Russia where, in 1992, used toothbrushes were sold on the sidewalks, while now shops are filled with luxury goods and the streets are jammed with Mercedes. Stalin's specter hovers throughout, and in the book's crescendo Brent takes us deep into the dictator's personal papers to glimpse the dark heart of the new Russia. Both cultural history and personal memoir, <em>Inside the Stalin Archives</em> is a deeply felt and vivid portrait of Russia in the twenty-first century. <br> <br></p><p><strong>Jonathan Brent</strong> is the editorial director of Yale University Press, where he founded the <em>Annals of Communism</em> series in 1991. He is the coauthor of <em>Stalin's Last Crime</em>, and a frequent contributor to the <em>New Criterion</em>, the <em>Observer</em>, and the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>. He teaches Soviet literature and history at Bard College and lives in New Haven, Connecticut.<br>&#x201c;In a strongly-written, fascinating, and original book, Jonathan Brent interweaves portraits of Russians in their daily lives with an astute analysis of Joseph Stalin's legacy.&#x201d; (<strong>Philip Roth</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Inside the Stalin Archives</em> is a necessary report from the Soviet netherworld of totalizing injustice that ought to have been universally known throughout the greater part of the twentieth century&#x2014;when it could not have existed. Jonathan Brent&#x2019;s discoveries will shake and shock and indispensably enlighten.&#x201d; (<strong>Cynthia Ozick</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;The author is careful to make neither heroes nor villains of the ghosts he summons from the archives, incorporating flawed personalities into stories of unthinkable justice.&#x201d; (<strong>Katya Tylevich - <em>readrussia.com</em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Brent seized a unique opportunity that, if not for him, would doubtless have been missed....[H]is book shows us the conditions&#x2014;moral, personal, and material&#x2014;that Russians take for granted but which are utterly unlike anything Americans have ever experienced.&#x201d; (<strong>Gary Saul Morson - <em>The New Criterion</em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;In the first part of his engaging and well-written memoir, <em>Inside the Stalin Archives</em>, Brent tells the story of the [Annals of Communism's] genesis. He conjures up the Moscow of the early 1990s, a time when the Russians were struggling to recover from the loss of the old certainties following the collapse of the Soviet system and adapt to a market-based economy.&#x201d; (<strong>Orlando Figes - <em>The New York Review</em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating, subtle, and finely written quest into the Russia of today through the dark labyrinth of history.

Equipped with little Russian and few contacts, but with an almost palpable sense of decency and honest intentions that illuminate his book, Brent explains for the general reader as well as for specialists how he went about his work in the new Russia.&#x201d; (<strong>Martin Walker - <em>New York Times Review of Books</em></strong>)</p><h2>A Dictionary For The Oil And Gas Industry</h2><p>A best-selling resource for all industry personnel, this reference contains over 11,000 definitions of terms used in petroleum geology, exploration, drilling, production, pipelining, processing, refining, accounting, and marketing.

It challenges every preconceived idea about great lovers and answers one of history&#x2019;s most vexing questions: what do women want?</strong></p> Contrary to popular myth and dogma, the men who consistently beguile women belie the familiar stereotypes: satanic rake, alpha stud, slick player, Mr. Nice, or big-money mogul. As Betsy Prioleau, author of <em>Seductress</em>, points out in this surprising, insightful study, legendary ladies&#x2019; men are a different, complex species altogether, often without looks or money. They fit no known template and possess a cache of powerful erotic secrets. <p>With wit and erudition, Prioleau cuts through the cultural lore and reveals who these master lovers really are and the arts they practice to enswoon women. What she discovers is revolutionary. Using evidence from science, popular culture, fiction, anthropology, and history, and from interviews with colorful real-world ladykillers, Prioleau finds that great seducers share a constellation of unusual traits.</p><p>While these men run the gamut, they radiate joie de vivre, intensity, and sex appeal; above all, they adore women. They listen, praise, amuse, and delight, and they know their way around the bedroom. And they&#x2019;ve finessed the hardest part: locking in and revving desire. Women never tire of these fascinators and often, like Casanova&#x2019;s conquests, remain besotted for life.</p><p>Finally, Prioleau takes stock of the contemporary culture and asks: where are the Casanovas of today? After a critique of the twenty-first-century sexual malaise&#x2015;the gulf between the sexes and women&#x2019;s record discontent&#x2015;she compellingly argues that society needs ladies&#x2019; men more than ever. Groundbreaking and provocative, <em>Swoon</em> is underpinned with sharp analysis, brilliant research, and served up with seductive verve.</p> 12 illustrations</p><p>Betsy Prioleau is the author of Seductress and Circle of Eros and was a scholar in residence at New York University where she taught cultural history.

A merrily readable literary history/dating manual.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Betsy Prioleau&#x2019;s vivacious prose grabs the reader, as does her marvelous wit, her insight into sexual desire, and her extraordinary research. It&#x2019;s a fascinating, very sexy read, especially her interviews with great lovers of today who detail why they&#x2019;re so successful in their seduction of women.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Barbara Taylor Bradford, author of <i>Letter from a Stranger</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Swoon</em> is a revelatory&#x2015;and revolutionary&#x2015;work that radically expands our understanding of human desire and unveils the mysteries surrounding passionate love.

When tragedy struck, he became their guide and a comforter of piercing insight and compassion. His letters are carefully preserved and reproduced in this moving account of the extraordinary love between Sheldon Vanauken and Jean Davis. This beautiful tale bears witness not only to the relationship between Van and Davy, but to the understanding which grew between two men who both had to suffer the severe pain of loss.</p><p><i>A Severe Mercy</i>, by Sheldon Vanauken, is a heart-rending love story described by its author as "the spiritual autobiography of a love rather than of the lovers." Vanauken chronicles the birth of a powerful pagan love borne out of the relationship he shares with his wife, Davy, and describes the growth of their relationship and the dreams that they share. As a symbol of their love, they name their dream schooner the <i>Grey Goose</i>, "for the grey goose, if its mate is killed flies on alone and never takes another." <p> While studying at Oxford, Sheldon and Davy develop a friendship with C.S. Lewis, under whose influence and with much intellectual scrutiny they accept the Christian doctrine. As their devotion to God intensifies, Sheldon realizes that he is no longer Davy's primary love--God is. Within this discovery begins a brewing jealousy.</p><p> Shortly after, Davy acquires a fatal illness. After her death Sheldon embarks on an intense experience of grief, "to find the meaning of it, taste the whole of it ... to learn from sorrow whatever it had to teach." Through painstaking reveries, he comes to discover the meaning of "a mercy as severe as death, a severity as merciful as love." He learns that her death "had these results: It brought me as nothing else could do to know and end my jealously of God. It saved her faith from assault. ...And it saved our love from perishing."</p><p> Replete with 18 letters from C.S. Lewis, <i>A Severe Mercy</i> addresses some of the universal questions that surround faith--the existence of God and the reasons behind tragedy. <i>--Jacque Holthusen</i></p>Beloved, profoundly moving account of the author&#39;s marriage, the couple&#39;s search for faith and friendship with C.

It instantly became a sizzling, international bestseller that lanced the boil of Windsor family dysfunction, triggering a chain of events that led to Charles and Diana's divorce. After her tragic death in 1997, Andrew Morton revealed that Diana herself had not only been the main source for the book, but had also edited his original drafts for accuracy. In return for this gold mine of information, Diana wanted complete anonymity for fear of retaliation from the queen. <i>Her True Story in Her Own Words</i> is enhanced by more than 75 full-color photographs of the princess, from her childhood in Althorp to her marriage to Charles at Westminster Abbey to her humanitarian efforts, and finally to her unforgettable funeral service. However, the most poignant portrayal of the princess emerges from the unedited transcriptions of Diana's interviews with Morton: "I think I'm going to cut a very different path from everyone else. I'm going to break away from this setup and go and help the man on the street."<p>The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana has caused the entire world to reflect on how much this singular woman meant to us all. From her fairy-tale courtship, her wedding to Prince Charles, and the birth of her two wonderful boys to the stunning collapse of her marriage and the revelation of her psychological and physical trauma, we witnessed and shared in the wide range of emotions in her life. In the last few years, Diana's dedication to the downtrodden and unloved and her commitment as a mother have only strengthened her hold on our hearts. </p><p>When <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was initially published in 1992, it was met with a hail of abuse from the British Establishment. As time passed, however, the magnitude of Diana's marital and personal distress made it clear, even to the greatest doubters, that this book was indeed Diana's true story; and finally, in 1995, she revealed in a BBC interview that she had indirectly cooperated with Andrew Morton. </p><p>What has not been known, however, until the publication of this new edition, is that <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was in fact almost entirely based on her own words, supplemented by interviews with her friends. In 1991 and 1992, when this book was first conceived and written, Diana felt trapped and powerless within the royal family. She knew that the truth about her life was submerged under a mountain of royal propaganda. <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> chronicles Diana's unhappiness, which began shortly before her wedding day, and reveals the life of a young and beautiful woman who, trapped in a loveless marriage, had sunk to the depths of despair; from which recovery seemed impossible. In an act of desperation, she made the decision in 1991 to tell her own story, no matter what the cost. And so she and Andrew Morton began a collaboration that was to shake the royal family to its foundations and, eventually, force Diana to seek a new life. Tragically, that new, and briefly happy, life is over. </p><p>This new edition contains the story of how the book first came into being. What's more, Diana is able, finally, to tell her own story, in her own words. Its pages contain her own testament -- the closest we will ever come to her autobiography.</p></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Last Soldier in America</h2><p>The story of Georg Gaertner, the only remaining German prisoner of war still at large in America and how he eluded the FBI for forty years</p><p></p><h2>Eon: Dragoneye Reborn</h2><p>Eon has been studying the ancient art of Dragon Magic for four years, hoping he&#39;ll be able to apprentice to one of the twelve energy dragons of good fortune.

Commissioned by Oxford University Press in the 1930s, when Auden's own work was at its boldest, the book caught its original publisher off guard. For it is less a collection of humorous verses than a celebration of the popular voice in English, in which the work of great satirists like Swift and Byron keeps company with ballads, chanteys, ditties, nursery rhymes, street calls, bathroom graffiti, epitaphs, folk songs, vaudeville turns, limericks, and blues. Turning away from the post-Romantic cult of the sentimental lyric, Auden features poetry that is clear, enjoyable, and, no matter its age, absolutely modern.<br><br>This new edition includes previously censored poems, together with Auden's remarkable introduction and a new preface by his literary executor, Edward Mendelson.</p><p><b>W.H.

It complements a diagram of the different positions and dynamics that make up the economy that necessitates work. Together, the book and diagram outline an analysis of capitalism: what it is, how it works, how we might dis- mantle it. And the book, the diagram, and the analysis are all outgrowths of something more a movement of people determined to fight it. <p> So this book isn t just an attempt to describe reality but also a tool with which to change it.

What qualifies us to write this? Some of us used to be students or pizza deliverers or dishwashers; others still are construction workers or graphic designers or civic-minded criminals. But all of us have lived under capitalism since we were born, and that makes us experts on it. The same goes for you. No one has to have a degree in economics to understand what s happening: it s enough to get a paycheck or a pink slip and pay attention. We re suspicious of the experts who get their credentials from on high, who have incentives to minimize things that are obvious to everyone else. </p><p> Like every attempt to construct a scale model of the world, this one is bound to be partial in both senses of the word. To present the whole story, it would have to be as vast as history. There s no way to be unbiased, either: our positions and values inevitably influence what we include and what we leave out. What we offer here is simply one perspective from our side of the counter and our side of the barricades.

Leading landscape designers such as Shunmyo Masuno, Masatoshi Takebe, Atsuchi Akenuki, and Yasujirou Aoki, as well as architects such as Kengo Kuma, Kan Izue, and Kisho Kurokawa, have been experimenting more and more with the form, style, and content of their garden designs. <br><br>The Modern Japanese Garden is the first book to survey these contemporary Japanese gardens, presenting the designs in a way that is relevant to readers and their homes, whether it is in the East or West. Most of the locations have never been seen before in the West. In addition to important public gardens (such as that of the Tokyu Hotel Cerulean Tower, Shibuya) there are examples of some of the best modern domestic gardens. Among the more experimental gardens featured are a water garden with glass rocks; a mountain garden with flashing kinetic rods; a house with a vegetable roof garden; a rock plaza that pumps out mist; and a rock garden built inside a large inclined tube. <br><br>With chapters exploring such themes as the influence on contemporary design of traditional Japanese cultural ideas, the miniaturization of landscape, sculpture, and texture, and the use by some garden designers of far more planting than was previously found in Japanese garden design, this inspirational book is required reading for all garden enthusiasts, especially those living in urban areas, as well as garden and landscape designers, and architects. <br><br><b>Garden design topics include:</b> <ul><li> Introduction by Shunmyo Masuno</li><li> Advancing Tradition</li><li> Miniaturization of Landscape</li><li> Sculptural and Textural Qualities.</li><li> The New Planted Garden</li></ul></p><p><b>Michael Freeman</b> is an award-winning photographer specializing in Asia, both for magazines such as the <i>Smithsonian, GEO,</i> and <i>Conde Nast Traveler</i> and for numerous books.

The Bomber, her first novel, has been on the bestseller list in Sweden for more than a year. She lives in Stockholm with her husband and three children.<b>Prologue</b><p>The woman who was about to die stepped warily out of the doorway and quickly glanced about her. The stairwell behind her lay in darkness; she hadn't switched on the light on her way down. In her pale coat, she was a ghostly apparition in the shadows of the entryway. She hesitated before stepping out onto the pavement, as if suspecting she was being watched. She took a couple of quick breaths, and for a few moments the white mist of her exhalation hovered around her head like a halo. Then she straightened the strap of her shoulder bag and took a firm grip of the handle of her briefcase. With hunched shoulders, she walked toward Gï¿½tgatan, taking quick, quiet steps. It was bitterly cold; a biting wind cut through her clothes. She sidestepped an icy patch and for a second was balancing on the curb. Then she hurried away from the streetlight and into the darkness. The sounds of the night were muffled: the sighing of a ventilation system, the yelling of some drunken youths, a faraway siren.</p><p>The woman's stride was confident and determined. She exuded assurance and expensive perfume. When her cellphone suddenly rang, she was completely taken aback. Freezing in mid-step, she quickly looked behind her. She bent down to lean the briefcase against her leg. While she rummaged in her handbag, her whole being positively oozed annoyance. She fished out her phone and put it to her ear. Despite the darkness and the shadows, her reaction could not be misjudged. Her irritation turned to surprise, then to anger, and finally, fear.</p><p>When she finished the call, the woman stood still for a few seconds, phone in hand. She bent her head, seemingly lost in thought. A police car drove slowly past. The woman looked up at it, watchful, following it with her gaze. She made no attempt to stop it.</p><p>Then she appeared to make up her mind. She turned around and started walking back the way she had come, past the dark doorway and up to the crossing at the corner of Katarina Bangata. While waiting for a night bus to drive past, she lifted her head and followed the street with her eyes, past Vintertullstorget and across Sickla Canal. Floating high above it lay the main Olympic arena, Victoria Stadium, where the Summer Olympics would open in seven months' time.</p><p>After the bus passed by, the woman crossed Ringvï¿½gen and started walking along Katarina Bangata. Her face was expressionless; her hurried steps testified to how cold she felt. She took the footbridge across the canal and entered the Olympic compound via the media village. With sharp and somewhat jerky movements, she hurried toward the stadium. She chose the route along the water's edge, although it was a longer and colder walk: A freezing wind blew in from the sea. But she did not wish to be seen. She repeatedly stumbled in the dense darkness.</p><p>When she reached the post office and the pharmacy, she turned up toward the training area and ran the last few hundred yards to the arena. By the time she reached the main entrance, she was out of breath as well as angry. She pulled the door open and stepped into the darkness.</p><p>"Tell me what you want, and be quick about it," she said with a cold look at the person who appeared from the shadows.</p><p>She saw the raised hammer but had no time to be afraid.</p><p>The first blow landed on her left eye.</p><p><b>Existence</b></p><p><i>Just behind the upper fence lay a huge anthill. As a child, I used to study it with utter concentration. I would stand so close that the insects were constantly crawling on my legs. Sometimes I followed a single ant from the grass in front of the house, across the gravel road, along the sandbank, and up to the anthill. There I would steel my gaze so as not to lose sight of the insect, but I always did. Other ants would catch my attention. When they became too numerous, my focus would splinter into so many pieces that I lost patience.</i></p><p><i>Sometimes I would put a lump of sugar on the hill. The ants loved my gift, and I smiled while they poured over it and pulled it down into the depth of the hill. In the autumn, when days grew colder and the ants slowed down, I would stir the hill with a stick to wake them up again. The grown-ups were angry when they saw what I was doing. They said that I was sabotaging the work of the ants and had ruined their home. To this day, I remember the feeling of injustice. I meant no harm. I just wanted a bit of fun. I wanted to rouse the little creatures.</i></p><p><i>My game with the ants haunted me in my dreams. My fascination turned into an unspeakable fear of their crawling. In my adult life, I have never been able to bear seeing more than three insects at a time, of whatever kind. As soon as I'm unable to take them all in, panic starts building up. My phobia came into being the moment I discovered the parallel between myself and the little insects.</i></p><p><i>I was young and still actively searching for answers to my condition, building theories in my mind, trying them out against each other in different problems I would formulate. That life could be arbitrary was not part of my worldview. Something had created me. I was not to be the judge of what that something was: chance, fate, evolution, or possibly God.</i></p><p><i>That life could be without meaning, however, I considered likely, and this filled me with sorrow and rage. If our time on earth had no purpose, then our lives appeared to be an exercise in irony. Someone put us here to study us as we made war, crawled around, suffered, and struggled. At times this Someone would confer a reward on us at random -- much like putting a lump of sugar on an anthill -- and watch our joy and despair with the same indifference.</i></p><p><i>My certainty grew with the years. In the end, I realized that it makes no difference whether there is a higher meaning to my life or not. Even if there is, I am not supposed to know of it here and now. If there were answers to be found, I would already know what they were, and since I don't, it makes no difference however much I think about it.</i></p><p><i>This has given me some measure of peace of mind.</i></p><p>Copyright ï¿½ 1998 by Liza Marklund</p></p><h2>The Hawaiian Archipelago: Six Months Among the Palm Groves, Coral Reefs and Volcanoes of the Sandwich Islands</h2><p><p>Isabella Bird visited the Sandwich Islands in 1871, when she was forty.

For the center of his cutting satire of American business he created the bustling, shallow, and myopic George F. Babbitt, the epitome of middle-class mediocrity. The novel cemented Lewis&#x2019;s prominence as a social commentator. <br><br>Babbitt basks in his pedestrian success and the popularity it has brought him. He demands high moral standards from those around him while flirting with women, and he yearns to have rich friends while shunning those less fortunate than he.

General Tom Franks embodies those qualities: strength, experience, a keen mind, energy, honor, good humor, and a deep loyalty to his troops and to his country. <p></p><p>"Tom Franks is truly a soldier's soldier."</p><p>-- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld</p></blockquote><p></p><p> The Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, General Tommy Franks made history by leading American and Coalition forces to victory in Afghanistan and Iraq -- the decisive battles that launched the war on terrorism. </p><p> In this riveting memoir, General Franks retraces his journey from a small-town boyhood in Oklahoma and Midland, Texas, through a lifetime of military service -- including his heroic tour as an Artillery officer in Vietnam, where he was wounded three times. A reform-minded Cold War commander and a shrewd tactician during Operation Desert Storm, Franks took command of CENTCOM at the dawn of what he calls a "crease in history" -- becoming the senior American military officer in the most dangerous region on earth. </p><p> Now, drawing on his own recollections and military records declassified for this book, Franks offers the first true insider's account of the war on terrorism that has changed the world since September 11, 2001. He puts you in the Operations Center for the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom just weeks after 9/11, capturing its uncertain early days and the historic victory that followed. He traces his relationship with the demanding Donald Rumsfeld, as early tensions over the pace of the campaign gave way to a strong and friendly collaboration. </p><p> When President Bush focused world attention on the threat of Iraq, Franks seized the moment to implement a bold new vision of joint warfare in planning Operation Iraqi Freedom. Rejecting Desert Storm&#x2013;style massive troop deployment in favor of flexibility and speed, Franks was questioned by the defense establishment -- including Secretary of State Colin Powell. Yet his vision was proven on the ground: Within three weeks, Baghdad had fallen.</p><p><em>American Soldier</em> is filled with revelation. Franks describes the covert diplomacy that helped him secure international cooperation for the war, and reveals the role of foreign leaders -- and a critical double agent code-named "April Fool" -- in the most successful military deception since D-Day in 1944. He speaks frankly of intelligence shortcomings that endangered our troops, and of the credible WMD threats -- including eleventh-hour warnings from Arab leaders -- that influenced every planning decision. He offers an unvarnished portrait of the "disruptive and divisive" Washington bureaucracy, and&nbsp;a candid assessment&nbsp;of the war's aftermath. Yet in the end, as <em>American Soldier</em> demonstrates, the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq remain heroic victories -- wars of liberation won by troops whose valor was "unequalled," Franks writes, "by anything in the annals of war." </p><p>Few individuals have the chance to contribute so much of themselves to the American story as General Tommy Franks. In <em>American Soldier</em>, he captures it all. </p></p><p>As Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, Tommy Franks led the American and Coalition forces to victory in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Unsurprisingly, the portions of <i>American Soldier</i> covering these wars are the most interesting because they combine military maneuvers, political wrangling, and lots of action and commentary. This does not mean, however, that the rest of his autobiography is dull. General Franks's writing is clear and engaging and his insider's perspective is informative and interesting, particularly when he explains how the military moved into the 21st century by emphasizing speed, agility, and better cooperation among the various branches--a significant shift from the first Persian Gulf war just a decade earlier. <p></p><p> In addition to his years as a war general, his memoir also covers his childhood, his early years in the Army, his tours of Vietnam, and how he contemplated retirement before being called up as commander of Central Command, "the most diverse, strategically vital&#x2014;and unstable&#x2014;region of the planet." Ever the diplomat, General Franks offers insights, but little criticism of individuals. Other than expressing admiration for his own staff and for President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in particular, he is tight-lipped about any conflict within the administration that may have occurred regarding policy issues. (The one exception is counterterrorism specialist Richard Clarke. "I never received a single operational recommendation, or a single page of actionable intelligence, from Richard Clarke," he writes). He also writes that he was surprised by the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that no WMDs were used against American troops. Still, the invasion of Iraq was justified in his eyes: "While we may not have found actual WMD stockpiles, what the Coalition discovered was the equivalent of a disassembled pistol, lying on a table beside neatly arranged trays of bullets." <i>American Soldier</i> is a compelling look at the war on terrorism from one who served on the frontlines as both a warrior and a diplomat. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p>General Tommy Franks retired from the Army on August 1, 2003. Commissioned a Second Lieutenant in 1967 as a distinguished graduate of the Artillery Officer Candidate School, Fort Sill, Oklahoma, he was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division, Republic of Vietnam. He also served as an Assistant Division Commander during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. General Franks has been awarded three Defense Distinguished Service Medals, two Distinguished Service Medals, and four Legion of Merit awards. His other decorations include three Purple Hearts, three Bronze Stars, an Air Medal, and an Army Commendation Medal -- all with "V" for valor. In 2004 he was named a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. General Franks lives with his wife, Cathy, in Tampa, Florida.</p></p><h2>Prince Caspian (Chronicles of Narnia)</h2><p>The second book in the Chronicles of Narnia Series. &#34;This sequel to an earlier adventure in Fairyland ... has the same down-to-earth qualities.&#34; ---The New York Times</p><p>Narnia has been at peace since Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund helped rid the kingdom of the evil White Witch.

Since the English monarchs also asserted control over the Church in England, a change in rulers could change the legal status of religious practices. As a consequence, adherents of one religion risked judicial execution by the State depending on the attitudes of the rulers. During Mary&#39;s reign, common people of Christian faith were publicly burned at the stake in an attempt to eliminate dissension from Catholic doctrines. Foxe&#39;s account of Mary&#39;s reign and the martyrdoms that took place during it contributed very significantly to the belief in a distinction from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope as a central aspect of English national identity. By compiling his record, Foxe intended to demonstrate a historical justification for the foundation of the Church of England as a contemporary embodiment of the true and faithful church, rather than as a newly established Christian denomination.</p><p>Originally published in the 16th century, this is the classic history of the lives, sufferings, and deaths of the early Christian martyrs. (Audio Book)John Foxe (1516-1587) was an academic and zealous student of the Scriptures, leading to his persecution as a Protestant by the Catholic rulers of his day. Beyond his work in pastoral ministry, Foxe continued to work on his martyrology until his death.</p><h2>Genealogy as Pastime and Profession, Second Edition</h2><p>A classic examination of the materials, techniques, and cultural, sociological, and professional aspects of genealogy</p><p>Under the leadership of Donald Lines Jacobus (1887-1970), serious genealogical research in the United States may be said to have come of age.

You'll make these connections by linking the exercises. A character invented in chapter two can appear in a scene outlined in chapter eight and can speak in a voice developed in chapter ten.</p><p>Embark on a unique writing journey and learn step by step how to craft fiction that captivates readers.</p></p><p>Many writers pooh-pooh the concept of writing exercises. Exercises seem perhaps an unnatural way to approach a seemingly organic process, and it can be hard to see them amounting to anything more than, well, exercises. While the great writers of the past may not have bothered with writing exercises, says Josip Novakovich in his introduction to <i>Writing Fiction Step by Step</i>, "they exercised by writing letters and by keeping journals and jotting down sketches." In other words, the telephone has made us lazy, and someone has to prod us into shape. So Novakovich proposes an "exercise plan" sure to stretch every fiction-writing muscle you've got. His 200-plus exercises are arranged by fictional element--starting with ideas, character, and plot moving through scene, dialogue, image, etc., and landing, finally, on "putting it all together." Each assignment is accompanied by a description of its purpose, a handful of writing tips, and a sort of teacher's checklist (about the ocean, for instance, he asks, "Where is the salt in your description?"). The exercises are playful, unusual, and meant to make your imaginative noodle dance. And don't worry--Novakovich doesn't want you to toil for naught; throughout the book he suggests ways in which you can combine various exercises to get something like a real piece of fiction going. In fact, he says, connecting the exercises might stimulate your fiction in surprising ways. After all, "putting different images together is the basic element of imagination." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p><h2>The Quest for the Green Man</h2><p>The Green Man is the archetype of the generative masculine energy of the earth.

In Arnosky's shimmering world, five bunnies emerge from their nest under the hedge for the very first time. Romping in the sun-drenched fields, meeting grasshoppers, spiders, and bees, the baby rabbits' curiosity is evident even as they stick close to their mother. A sudden storm causes them to hurry back and huddle inside their shelter, where other animals join them as they watch honeybees fly between the raindrops. Then the rain stops and the six reemerge to "play rabbit tag in the sun." The simple text carries readers along rhythmically and naturally as the day unfolds. Drawn from the animals' perspective, the glowing illustrations are precise in their depiction of the wildlife; the bright, vibrant watercolors flow from hot yellows and luminescent greens to the muted blues of rain.

Perfect for story-time or lap-time reading, this book will give children a feeling of security and contentment.?Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Arnosky (Nearer Nature, p. 964, etc.) continues his nature observations in this tale of five bunnies who come out to play in the grass with their mother and spot a caterpillar, butterfly, bird, spider, bumblebee, and more small creatures before raindrops chase them back under the hedge. Small rabbits--and other creatures that come in from the rain--appear in appealing green, gold, and brown scenes that will charm young viewers. Children may not understand (or care) that raindrops remain spherical--as depicted in the illustrations--when they fall, but adults will probably question such a literal depiction of a phenomenon that cannot be seen by the human eye. It's an admirable attempt to make nature accessible, but the real story is in the playfulness of the bunnies and the world they inhabit.

We feel that the poser of the Tarot derives from an ancient and complex symbology that represents all aspects, forces, stages, configurations in our psychic lives - a totality of human experience. If we look at its ancestry we will see that the Tarot is a particularly appropriate vehicle for women with feminist consciousness. At its very core it is synchronous with that vision which honors the female principle as a creative and dynamic force in the universe. We have also included the traditional meanings of the cards so that the reader herself may compare the distinctiveness of the feminist interpretations, at the same time noting their kinship with the historical Tarot.</p><p></p><h2>The Case of the Troubled Trustee</h2><p>An erstwhile young man has his hands full as trustee of a wild young woman&#39;s inheritance.

Akimbo lives on the large African game reserve where his father works, and is constantly on the lookout for an opportunity to see or learn something new. In <i>Akimbo and the Elephants</i>, the resourceful Akimbo helps foil an elephant poaching ring by secretly taking ivory seized by the park wardens and offering it to known poachers. When the poachers take the bait and invite Akimbo along on their illegal hunt, the boy slips away from the men and alerts the authorities. In <i>Akimbo and the Lions</i>, Akimbo helps raise a lion cub that is accidentally caught in a farmer's trap and learns the true meaning of s! acrifice when he must release his beloved Simba back into the wild. While Akimbo occasionally comes close to real danger, (an angry bull elephant charges towards him; a cornered lioness threatens him and his father) Smith always brings his small but determined hero safely out of harm's way, having both learned a valuable lesson and gone on a great adventure.

Luckily, this is not just a recounting of a winter's worth of cabin fever. Instead, Dobisz takes us into her cabin, and into her mind, as she tries--at least temporarily--to live a Walden-like existence.<br> <br>All the bowing and meditating and wood-chopping that is part and parcel of her retreat is hardly first nature, but the good-humored and tenacious Dobisz is able to adapt, and to relate her hundred days with moving insight and humanity. Her <i>Solitude</i> in fact offers us all a chance to commune with her and to look inside and rediscover our own grace.</p><p>Jane Dobisz (Zen Master Bon Yeon) is a Guiding Teacher of the Cambridge Zen Center, where she was Abbot for four years and where she lived for ten years. A student of Zen Master Seung Sahn since 1982, she has practiced extensively in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. An advisor in the financial services industry, she lives in the Boston area with her husband and daughter."For 100 days of a snowy New England winter, Dobisz lived alone in a tiny cabin in the woods, adhering to a highly regimented schedule of sitting, walking, chanting, bowing, and chopping wood. She had no contact with the outside world. The experience gave her opportunity to see in a new light things most of us take for granted: keeping warm, taking a bath, getting a drink of water. Everything there was elemental. More than once, she asked herself what utter madness brought her there. Yet she writes luminously about the spectacle of nature, the sensual pleasure of a hot bath, the simple joy of silence. She isn't all wide-eyed wonder, though. She can be quite funny recounting such happenstances as, while out walking, coming upon a parked car, picnic basket in the backseat, full of goodies, including several Lorna Doones...(She scarfed them down.) After her time in the woods, Dobisz went home the same person and yet, in the way of Zen, not quite the same person." Source: Booklist<br><br>"Splendidly candid and beautifully written... There have been plenty of other books about solitude and the refreshments emerging out of silence and communion with the natural world but this one is special because of its radiant glints of wisdom about Zen."

With wit, seriousness, and freshness, she gives a powerful account of facing life and reality head-on."

Author: Sylvia Boorstein, author of It's Easier than You Think<br><br>"Rich with humility and humor--Dobisz finds lessons in Zen and life in everything from the frozen rock-solid contents of her chamber pot to the temptations in a package of Lorna Doones." Source: Vermont Quarterly<br><br>"Dobisz's book describes how loneliness and discomfort evolved into joy as, forced by the absence of distraction and the repetition of simple activities, she learned to focus on each moment--the essence of Zen teaching--and came to treasure life in a way many people don't." Source: Boston Globe<br><br>"Jane Dobisz, as so many students of Buddhism have done, decided to live a solitary life with nature for a time, 100 days to be exact, during the winter and spring months so that she could experience the harshness of winter and then the jubilation of spring. As I allowed myself to enter her world and release my cynical ponderings, the book began to calm me... This is not really a book to be read in one or two sittings. It is one of those books that you leave by your bedside. You pick it up, and randomly choose a chapter.

Across a double-spread title page, a thin sliver of moon hovers over a darkened sky, sun-streaked with dawn. Head back, a coyote howls a morning greeting. With this, Rand delivers a striking visual introduction to Lesser's poetic description of the coming violent downpour and the passing of a desert storm. The narration begins quietly ("Silence wanders/Through ironwood trees"), quickens as the gale hits ("Rain shatters the earth"), and slows in the aftermath (Lightning an elusive flicker,/Thunder a murmur"). Lesser's pace and phrasing inject atmosphere, making this a good read aloud and a good introduction to desert flora and fauna. The ongoing actions of a coyote provide an element of story, while the inclusion of other wildlife?jackrabbits, poppies, vultures, rain lilies, beetles, and lizards?flesh out the desert scene. Some of Rand's images are mesmerizing?animals scurrying through the storm, some silhouetted against "billows of dust"; however, the textless spreads (one of lightning, another of a rainbow, and a third of a desert in bloom) are ordinary and tend to disrupt the narrative flow. Nevertheless, this title makes a fitting companion to Diane Siebert and Wendell Minor's Mojave (HarperCollins, 1988) and to Byrd Baylor and Peter Parnall's books; it could also work well in introducing older readers to novels such as Angela Johnson's Toning the Sweep (Orchard, 1993) or Gloria Skurzynski's Lost in the Devil's Desert (Morrow, 1993).?Barbara Elleman, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sailing Alone around the World (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The classic travel narrative of a Don Quixote-of-the-seas &#x2013; the first man to circumnavigate the world singlehandedly.</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joshua Slocum&#x2019;s autobiographical account of his solo trip around the world is one of the most remarkable &#x2013; and entertaining &#x2013; travel narratives of all time.

One of the leading American stage actors of his generation, now in his sixties, he has lost his magic, his talent, and his assurance. His Falstaff and Peer Gynt and Vanya, all his great roles, "are melted into air, into thin air." When he goes onstage he feels like a lunatic and looks like an idiot. His confidence in his powers has drained away; he imagines people laughing at him; he can no longer pretend to be someone else. "Something fundamental has vanished." His wife has gone, his audience has left him, his agent can t persuade him to make a comeback.<br><br>Into this shattering account of inexplicable and terrifying self-evacuation bursts a counterplot of unusual erotic desire, a consolation for a bereft life so risky and aberrant that it points not toward comfort and gratification but to a yet darker and more shocking end. In this long day s journey into night, told with Roth s inimitable urgency, bravura, and gravity, all the ways that we convince ourselves of our solidity, all our life s performances talent, love, sex, hope, energy, reputation are stripped off.<br><br>The Humbling is Roth s thirtieth book.</p><p>In 1997, Philip Roth won the Pulitzer Prize for American Pastoral. In 1998 he received the National Medal of Arts at the White House and in 2002 the highest award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Gold Medal in Fiction, previously awarded to John Dos Passos, William Faulkner, and Saul Bellow, among others. He has twice won the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. He has won the PEN/Faulkner Award three times.&nbsp;Recently Roth received PEN's two most prestigious prizes: in 2006 the PEN/Nabokov Award for "a body of work.of enduring originality and consummate craftsmanship" and in 2007 the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for achievement in American Fiction, given to a writer whose "scale of achievement over a sustained career.places him or her in the highest rank of American literature." Roth is the only living American writer to have his work published in a comprehensive, definitive edition by the Library of America.1.<br>Into Thin Air<br><br>He'd lost his magic. The impulse was spent. He'd never failed in the theater, everything he had done had been strong and successful, and then the terrible thing happened: he couldn't act. Going onstage had become agony. Instead of the certainty that he was going to be wonderful, he knew he was going to fail. It happened three times in a row, and by the last time nobody was interested, nobody came. He couldn't get over to the audience. His talent was dead.<br><br>Of course, if you've had it, you always have something unlike anyone else's. I'll always be unlike anyone else, Axler told himself, because I am who I am. I carry that with me&#x2014;that people will always remember. But the aura he'd had, all his mannerisms and eccentricities and personal peculiarities, what had worked for Falstaff and Peer Gynt and Vanya&#x2014;what had gained Simon Axler his reputation as the last of the best of the classical American stage actors&#x2014;none of it worked for any role now. All that had worked to make him himself now worked to make him look like a lunatic. He was conscious of every moment he was on the stage in the worst possible way. In the past when he was acting he wasn't thinking about anything. What he did well he did out of instinct. Now he was thinking about everything, and everything spontaneous and vital was killed&#x2014;he tried to control it with thinking and instead he destroyed it. All right, Axler told himself, he had hit a bad period. Though he was already in his sixties, maybe it would pass while he was still recognizably himself. He wouldn't be the first experienced actor to go through it. A lot of people did. I've done this before, he thought, so I'll find some way. I don't know how I'm going to get it this time, but I'll find it&#x2014;this will pass.<br><br>It didn't pass. He couldn't act. The ways he could once rivet attention on the stage! And now he dreaded every performance, and dreaded it all day long. He spent the entire day thinking thoughts he'd never thought before a performance in his life: I won't make it, I won't be able to do it, I'm playing the wrong roles, I'm overreaching, I'm faking, I have no idea even of how to do the first line. And meanwhile he tried to occupy the hours doing a hundred seemingly necessary things to prepare; I have to look at this speech again, and by the time he got to the theater he was exhausted. And dreading going out there. He would hear the cue coming closer and closer and know that he couldn't do it. He waited for the freedom to begin and the moment to become real, he waited to forget who he was and to become the person doing it, but instead he was standing there, completely empty, doing the kind of acting you do when you don't know what you are doing. He could not give and he could not withhold; he had no fluidity and he had no reserve. Acting became a night-after-night exercise in trying to get away with something.<br><br>It had started with people speaking to him. He couldn't have been more than three or four when he was already mesmerized by speaking and being spoken to. He had felt he was in a play from the outset. He could use intensity of listening, concentration, as lesser actors used fireworks. He had that power offstage, too, particularly, when younger, with women who did not realize that they had a story until he revealed to them that they had a story, a voice, and a style belonging to no other. The became actresses with Axler, they became the heroines of their own lives. Few stage actors could speak and be spoke to the way he could, yet he could do neither anymore. The sound that used to go into his ear felt as though it were going out, and every word he uttered seemed acted instead of spoken. The initial source in his acting was in what he heard, his response to what he heard was at the core of it, and if he couldn't listen, couldn't hear, he had nothing to go on. <br><br>He was asked to play Prospero and Macbeth at the Kennedy Center&#x2014;it was hard to think of a more ambitious double bill&#x2014;and he failed appallingly in both, but especially as Macbeth. He couldn't do low-intensity Shakespeare and he couldn't do high-intensity Shakespeare&#x2014;and he'd been doing Shakespeare all his life. His Macbeth was ludicrous and everyone who saw it said as much, and so did many who hadn't seen it. "No, the don't even have to have been there," he said, "to insult you." A lot of actors would have turned to drink to help themselves out an old joke had it that there was an actor who would always drink before he went onstage, and when he was warned "You musn't drink," he replied, "What, and go out there alone?" But Axler didn't drink, and so he collapsed instead. His breakdown was colossal. <br><br>The worst of it was that he saw through his breakdown the same way he could see through his acting. The suffering was excruciating and yet he doubted that it was genuine, which made it even worse. He did not know how he was going to get from one minute to the next, his mind felt as though it were melting, he was terrified to be alone, he could not sleep more than two or three hours a night, he scarcely ate, he thought every day of killing himself with the gun in the attic&#x2014;a Remington 870 pump-action shotgun that he kept in the isolate farmhouse for self-defense&#x2014;and still the whole thing seemed to be an act, a bad act. When you're playing the role of somebody coming apart, it has organization and order; when you're observing yourself coming apart, playing the role of your own demise, that's something else, something awash with terror and fear.</p><h2>Muhammad</h2><p>Examines the Islamic prophet&#39;s spiritual and political influence on Arab civilization</p><p><b>Maxime Rodinson</b> was for many years a professor at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes at the Sorbonne.

Before 1966, China was a typical communist state, with a command economy and a powerful party able to keep the population under control. But during the Cultural Revolution, in a move unprecedented in any communist country, Mao unleashed the Red Guards against the party. Tens of thousands of officials were humiliated, tortured, and even killed. Order had to be restored by the military, whose methods were often equally brutal. </p><p> In a masterly book, Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals explain why Mao launched the Cultural Revolution, and show his Machiavellian role in masterminding it (which Chinese publications conceal). In often horrifying detail, they document the Hobbesian state that ensued. The movement veered out of control and terror paralyzed the country. Power struggles raged among Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Qing&#x2014;Mao&#x2019;s wife and leader of the Gang of Four&#x2014;while Mao often played one against the other. </p><p> After Mao&#x2019;s death, in reaction to the killing and the chaos, Deng Xiaoping led China into a reform era in which capitalism flourishes and the party has lost its former authority. In its invaluable critical analysis of Chairman Mao and its brilliant portrait of a culture in turmoil, <i>Mao&#x2019;s Last Revolution</i> offers the most authoritative and compelling account to date of this seminal event in the history of China. </p></p><p>Roderick MacFarquhar is Leroy B. Williams Professor of History and Political Science, and Professor of Government, Harvard University.It has been enthralling to read Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals's exhaustively researched new book on China's Cultural Revolution -- a sensation akin to returning to a Chinese painting in which a mist-shrouded landscape has miraculously cleared to reveal what was obscured beyond. While it was not difficult to feel the tension, even the fear, aloft in the land when I reported from Mao Zedong's China for the New Yorker during the mid-1970s, being there gave few intimations of the dark complexity of the political struggle playing out beneath the surface. By making sense out of this opaque decade, MacFarquhar (who teaches at Harvard University) and Schoenhals (who teaches at Lund University in Sweden) have provided the most definitive roadmap to date of China's odyssey through those tumultuous times.<p>But what happened is still not easy to explain completely. For complex reasons that involved Mao's political beliefs as well as his own psychological pathologies, the communist leader felt compelled to goad China into an extended paroxysm of revolutionary madness that ran from 1966 to 1976. Both to protect his own political supremacy and to wrench China out of its "feudal" past, he made politics and "class struggle" the currency of his revolutionary realm. In his own words, he created "great disorder under heaven." Proclaiming that "to rebel is justified," he called on students to "bombard the headquarters" of the Communist Party and thus set in motion one of the most unprecedented upheavals of the 20th century.</p><p>"You ask us how to do it," President Liu Shaoqi, who later died as a political enemy in one of Mao's prisons, told students as the leftist surge gathered momentum. "I tell you honestly, I don't know either. We're mainly going to be relying on you to make this revolution." </p><p>In the name of wiping out "capitalist roaders" (a euphemism for anyone seemingly opposed to Mao's revolutionary line) and "bourgeois revisionism," tens of millions of innocent victims were persecuted, professionally ruined, mentally deranged, physically maimed and even killed. "Beat to a pulp any and all persons who go against Mao Zedong Thought -- no matter who they are, what banner they fly, or how exalted their positions may be," proclaimed one Red Guard poster. </p><p>"Whereas party violence had normally been carefully controlled and calibrated, now the rules had been suspended," note the authors. "Freed from parental and societal constraints, youths, both girls and boys, had been unleashed to perpetrate assault, battery, and murder upon their fellow citizens to the extent their barely formed consciences permitted. The result was the juvenile state of nature, nationwide, foreshadowed in microcosm by Nobel Prize-winner William Golding in Lord of the Flies." </p><p>A few of China's more pragmatic leaders did shrink from Mao's cataclysmic vision of revolutionary extremism. But Mao's Last Revolution suggests how easy it can be for a mercurial "Big Leader," operating within a totalitarian system, to throw doubters so far off balance that none was able to organize resistance. And if there is one thing that Marxist-Leninist states do well, it is defoliating the political landscape of checks and balances, as well as watchdog institutions like the press. This is especially true when the media fall into the hands of one faction so that any sense of the actual variety of contending viewpoints is eclipsed, making it impossible for an outsider to discern how different factions were actually struggling against each other behind the scenes.</p><p>Mao was a master of keeping all comers in a state of paralyzing uncertainty. He garnered enormous power from his imperial opaqueness: While almost everyone wished "to work toward" Mao and his policies in order to please him, they could never be quite sure whether they were measuring up. Mao was the embodiment par excellence of the advice implicitly given by the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov when he chastises Jesus for failing to compel belief by ruling by "miracle, mystery and authority." </p><p>By frequently absenting himself from the everyday sordidness of Beijing politics, Mao conjured up an almost otherworldly authority. And by making conflicting pronouncements that were impossible to factor together, he maintained both deniability and an ambiguity that kept his subordinates "transfixed like rabbits in front of a cobra," as the authors put it. </p><p>In the end, after years of chaos, even Mao seemed to realize that the party's ability to continue leading China hung in the balance. He then called back cashiered veteran army leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. Curiously, although most of them had been persecuted by Mao, when it came to evaluating his life after his death, they still gave Mao a pass, finding only 30 percent of his policies erroneous and 70 percent correct. But as Deng pragmatically observed, discrediting Mao "would mean discrediting our Party and state." And so, in the end, Mao's legacy as grand progenitor of the Chinese Communist Revolution was left largely intact, despite the horrors of this last revolutionary paroxysm.</p><p>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals have drawn from a truly impressive array of materials, including documents, wall posters, autobiographies, journalistic reports, interviews, speeches, academic studies and personal reminiscences. But here a cautionary word is in order. The field is awash with "wild" (rather than "official") histories and sources, which include autobiographies, memoirs, reminiscences and reflections filled with recovered memories and reconstructed dialogue of questionable provenance and accuracy. But the sources for this impressive book are more solid and varied than for any previous effort. One can only lament that Mao's Last Revolution will not be available in China, where the party's aversion to probing into such sensitive topics makes it unlikely that a similar historical research project will be forthcoming anytime soon. </p><p>China has come a long way since Mao. But neither he nor his revolution has been completely interred; his body still lies on public view in Tiananmen Square, his image remains on China's money, and his portrait still hangs on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. With China's political system still lacking the kinds of checks and balances that can bring a society back from the brink of extremism, optimism about its political future should be tempered by realism.</p><p>Indeed, this September, on the 30th anniversary of both Mao's death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the party still chose to spend a week celebrating his legacy, culminating with an official concert in the Great Hall of the People entitled "The Sun is the reddest and Chairman Mao is the most beloved." No mention was made of the incalculable damage his Cultural Revolution inflicted on his country. In the future, one important index of China's passage toward political maturity will be the degree to which it feels able to repudiate both Mao and his Cultural Revolution legacy. </p><p>Reviewed by Orville Schell <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Chris Hedges, a former foreign correspondent for the <i>New York Times</i> and Harvard Divinity School graduate, believes that the commandments keep us from committing evil. They hold our communities together. "They lead us to love, the essence of life," he writes. <p> Adapted from his series of articles for the <i>New York Times</i> comes these thoughtful essays on why we need these ancient laws -- and what happens when we abandon them. A Phish band groupie provides a springboard for a discussion of idolatry. A Long Island whiskey bar becomes a laboratory for understanding "You shall not bear false witness." Honoring the Sabbath, he shows through the observances of one busy family, may be the antidote to popular culture. The story of the havoc wreaked on one child&#x2019;s life vividly illustrates the reason for the commandment, "You shall not commit adultery." Throughout his essays, he deftly weaves his own experiences into the narrative, as well as references from Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s classic book on good and evil, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. </p><p> Hedges believes that the commandments hold out to us the possibility of love -- and love means living for others. The commandments are guideposts that bring us back to the right path, he writes. They call us to sacrifice. Compellingly, he urges us to abandon the culture of self; to live "not by exalting our life but by being willing to lose it." --<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p><b>Chris Hedges</b> was a foreign correspondent for nearly two decades for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> and National Public Radio.

Forthrightness is one of the best qualities of Carey's collection, which is sure to satisfy fans of his eponymous sitcom. In any event, there's little likelihood of the book falling into the wrong hands. Don't think penis jokes are funny? Don't buy it. Don't want to know what the censors wouldn't let Drew put in the show? Ditto. What makes Carey's no-nonsense attitude even more attractive is the fact that he often turns the spotlight on himself, like so: <blockquote> I know that I make a lot of jokes about it, but I'm not really happy with the way I look lately. My dream of finally being able to make it with an eighteen-year-old cheerleader is slipping through my fingers. <br> So, I'm going to lose the weight.<br> I'm going to lose the weight, get a light tan, and get my back waxed. And, I'm going to buy a cheerleader outfit for the next girl I start dating. A cheerleader outfit and a riding crop. Why hold back? </blockquote> There's an unexpected edge of dissatisfaction, of unprocessed anger, that seeps between the lines. Sometimes Carey ventures into boneheadedness--as in a pointless rant against the sexual harassment policy at Warner Brothers and how it makes his life hard. More often, though, he comes across as a drinking buddy on a particularly funny night. That's what Carey set out to do--and there's room on many bookshelves for that.Drew Carey grew up in Cleveland and started his career as a stand-up comic in his hometown after a disc jockey friend enlisted him to write some jokes for his radio show. A few years later, after appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, he scripted and starred in his own cable special &#34;Drew Carey: Human Cartoon,&#34; for which he won a Cable ACE Award. He was nominated for another Cable ACE Award in 1993 for his performance at the &#34;Tenth Anniversary of the Montreal Comedy Festival.&#34; After co-starring on one sitcom and co-writing another, Drew hooked up with writer/producer Bruce Helford, and created The Drew Carey Show.</p><h2>All the Myriad Ways</h2><p>He's faster that a speeding bullet.

Webre, J.D., author of <em>Exopolitics: Politics, Government, and Law in the Universe</em> <br> <br>In 1967, astronomers began receiving and cataloging precisely timed radio pulses from extraterrestrial sources, which they called pulsars. These pulsars emit laserlike radio beams that penetrate through space much like searchlight beams. Paul LaViolette, who has been researching pulsars for over twenty-five years, shows that while these pulsars have long been assumed to be spinning stars, the true nature of these radio sources has been grossly misunderstood. <br> <br>In <em>Decoding the Message of the Pulsars</em>, LaViolette shows that pulsars are distributed in the sky in a nonrandom fashion, often marking key galactic locations, and that their signals are of intelligent origin. Using extensive scientific data to corroborate his theory, he presents evidence of unusual geometric alignments among pulsars and intriguing pulse-period relationships. Equally compelling is the message LaViolette contends is being sent by these extraterrestrial beacons: a warning about a past galactic core explosion disaster that could recur in the near future. <br> <br>PAUL A.

As the novel opens, he is beginning to lose her. Not to another man, as he fears, but to, literally, nothing. Alice is a physicist, and a team at the University where both she and Philip work has created a hole, a vacuum, a doorway of nothingness inside the laboratory. They call it "Lack." Alice becomes obsessed with Lack, as Philip is obsessed by Alice.<br><br>The novel is at the same time an astute and wise portrait of unrequited love (albeit of a very unusual kind) a hilarious academic parody, a novel of ideas and a social satire. It is utterly original, but in the school of Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Katherine Dunn, and David Foster Wallace.<br><br>Passion, humor, yearning and knowledge, blended together in a suspenseful love story that could be characterized as "American Magical Realism."</p><p>Particle physics, false vacuum bubbles, an alternate universe--this is the stuff of Jonathan Lethem's novel <i>As She Climbed Across the Table</i>. The tale echoes <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> in its mad tumble through a rearranged reality. Narrator Phillip Engstrand is a university professor who has made a career out of studying academic environments. Engstrand is in love with Alice Coombs, a particle physicist engaged in a bold attempt to replicate the origins of the universe. The result of the experiment is Lack, a very selective black hole that sucks some things into its void--a cat, a pair of socks, a strawberry--and rejects others, namely, a love-struck Alice. As Alice's unrequited obsession with Lack grows, Phillip becomes so desperate to save his beloved from this empty rival that he risks a journey down the metaphysical rabbit hole. <p> Here the language of physics becomes the language of love: describing physics' "observer problem," Alice says, "Some people think the observer's consciousness determines the spin or even the existence of the electron." Later, as he stumbles to explain Alice's importance to him, Phillip tells her, "I'm not sure I really exist except under your observation." In this memorable little book, Lethem explores the cosmic possibilities of love.</p>Jonathan Lethem is the author of the novels <i>Gun, with Occasional Music</i>; <i>Amnesia Moon</i>;<i>&nbsp;Girl in Landscape</i>;<i>&nbsp;</i>and <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i>, for which he won the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Michael Shaara earned his battle stripes--and a Pulitzer Prize--for <i>The Killer Angels</i>, a fictional resurrection of the Battle of Gettysburg, as serious a subject as a writer can confront. Yet, it's no more profound, in the end, than the personal dilemmas protagonist Billy Chapel faces in this, Shaara's final novel, found stashed in a desk after his death and published posthumously.<p> A certain Hall of Famer, Chapel is a major-league anomaly, a contemporary throwback to another sporting era. He's pitched 17 stellar seasons for the same club, and his love of the game has remained paramount; neither money nor fame has been his motivation. But on the single day this story takes place, he finds himself in crisis. At the crossroads of his life, his career, and his future, he must make the hard choices that will define the direction of the rest of his life. It's the end of the season, his team's out of contention, there's a rumor he may have been traded, and the woman he can't fully acknowledge that he loves announces she's leaving him. It is, as he tells himself, "Time to grow up, Daydreamer." Still, he dreams, but he also acts. As Billy takes the mound for his final start of the year--and maybe forever--we enter his stream of consciousness, and rush with him over the sometimes treacherous rapids of what has preceded this moment, and what may come. Amazingly, though his mind seems to wander through time, his concentration is fierce. Pitch by pitch, inning by inning, he remains focused, honoring his job and his legacy as he pitches a masterpiece of mythic proportion, ultimately leaving the field more a man than when he took it. Using baseball to sound the depths of human experience, Shaara delivers a masterpiece, as well. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><br>"Moving, beautiful . . .

These stories, however, largely ignore black Appalachian lives. Karida L. Brown's <i>Gone Home</i> offers a much-needed corrective to the current whitewashing of Appalachia. In telling the stories of African Americans living and working in Appalachian coal towns, Brown offers a sweeping look at race, identity, changes in politics and policy, and black migration in the region and beyond.<br><br>Drawn from over 150 original oral history interviews with former and current residents of Harlan County, Kentucky, Brown shows that as the nation experienced enormous transformation from the pre- to the post-civil rights era, so too did black Americans. In reconstructing the life histories of black coal miners, Brown shows the mutable and shifting nature of collective identity, the struggles of labor and representation, and that Appalachia is far more diverse than you think.<br><br></p><p>Karida L.

In alternating chapters&#x2014;and in voices that are as eloquent as they are different&#x2014;they tell stories spanning more than fifty years of family history, and reflect on their journeys into two different kinds of faith.<br> <br> At twenty-one, still a struggling actor living hand to mouth, Martin and his wife, Janet, welcomed their firstborn, Emilio, an experience of profound joy for the young couple, who soon had three more children: Ramon, Charlie, and Renï¿½e. As Martin&#x2019;s career moved from stage to screen, the family moved from New York City to Malibu, while traveling together to film locations around the world, from Mexico for <i>Catch-22 </i>to Colorado for <i>Badlands </i>to the Philippines for the legendary <i>Apocalypse Now </i>shoot. As the firstborn, Emilio had a special relationship with Martin: They often mirrored each other&#x2019;s passions and sometimes clashed in their differences. After Martin and Emilio traveled together to India for the movie <i>Gandhi, </i>each felt the beginnings of a spiritual awakening that soon led Martin back to his Catholic roots, and eventually led both men to Spain, from where Martin&#x2019;s father had emigrated to the United States. Along the famed Camino de Santiago pilgrimage path, Emilio directed Martin in their acclaimed film, <i>The Way, </i>bringing three generations of Estevez men together in the region of Spain where Martin&#x2019;s father was born, and near where Emilio&#x2019;s own son had moved to marry and live.<br> <br> With vivid, behind-the-scenes anecdotes of this multitalented father&#x2019;s and son&#x2019;s work with other notable actors and directors, <i>Along the Way </i>is a striking, stirring, funny story&#x2014;a family saga that readers will recognize as universal in its rebellions and regrets, aspirations and triumphs. Strikingly candid, searchingly honest, this heartfelt portrait reveals two strong-minded, admirable men of many important roles, perhaps the greatest of which are as fathers and sons.</p><p>Martin Sheen&nbsp;was born (and still is) Ramon Antonio Gerardo Estevez.

He was calling from the editing room where he was working on <i>The Way,</i> our film about a father-and-son pilgrimage, written and directed by Emilio, in which I play his father. We&#x2019;d spent forty days filming in southwest France and northern Spain along the Camino de Santiago, the thousand-year-old, 500-mile route leading to the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of Saint James the Apostle are believed to be interred.<br> <br>The Camino de Santiago, also known as the Way of Saint James, is a sacred path for Christians and, in recent years, walking its length has become a spiritual endeavor for people of all religions and backgrounds. The Camino ends in Galicia, a region of northern Spain to which four generations of Estevez men are tied. My father, Francisco, was born and raised there and my grandson, Emilio&#x2019;s son Taylor, lives in Spain with his wife, Julia.<br> <br>Working with Emilio on <i>The Way</i> was one of the most extraordinary and satisfying projects of my life, and I longed for another father-son adventure with him. And that day Emilio was calling with just such a project.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, listen,&#x201d; Emilio said. &#x201c;Would you be interested in writing a dual memoir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A memoir? You mean a book?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. A father-son memoir. Whatta ya say?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was intrigued. To my knowledge no such memoir had ever been published, at least not in our profession. Married couples have written books together, but not a father and son. The possibility began to excite me and I bombarded him with questions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold on!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I just want to know if you&#x2019;re interested.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m interested,&#x201d; I assured him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d work with you on anything. Do you have an offer from a publisher?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly, but I have a meeting with a literary agent at my house this weekend. We&#x2019;re going to have lunch, chat, and see if there are enough reasons to pursue this.&#x201d; Then he hung up.<br> <br>I almost called him back to invite myself over for that lunch. After all, Emilio only lives a few hundred yards down the street from me and his mother, Janet. But I restrained myself and waited for him to report back.<br> <br><b>EMILIO</b><br> <br>That weekend, I sat on my outdoor patio with literary agent Scott Waxman and David Alexanian of Elixir Films, the producer for <i>The Way.</i> We were drinking wine that my partner Sonja and I had made and lunching on vegetables picked just two hours earlier from our backyard microfarm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emil, maybe you should tell Scott about the kind of book you have in mind,&#x201d; David said.<br> <br>I chewed on one of my homegrown cucumbers and stalled for time to come up with something pithy and meaningful.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a father-son story,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s what attracted me to it initially,&#x201d; Waxman said. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s not only about the filming and the experience?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. It&#x2019;s about how we got here, as men and as artists. Everyone thinks they already <i>know</i> the story. Truth is most folks don&#x2019;t know the half of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Scott leaned forward. He was interested in those stories, too, he said.<br> <br>So, here it is.

She truly has the patience of Job and listened to our stories, the good ones and the bad, and pulled them together in our own voices. We showed our scars and our triumphs, and sometimes our asses. In many ways, the entire exercise was like a long, drawn-out therapy session with Hope as our trinity&#x2014;counselor/confessor/writer.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ve chosen to be honest, even when it was painful to do so, and even when a scene is less than flattering to one or both of us. We&#x2019;ve done this in the hope that our story will inspire other fathers and sons to reflect on their journeys together and to inspire them to honor and give thanks for each other, in whatever way they can.<br> <br>This is our journey on the metaphorical &#x201c;road,&#x201d; the <i>camino</i> that <i>all</i> fathers and sons travel in some form or another.

By the time he was ten years old he knew he wanted to be an artist, and after leaving school he went on to study at Bradford Art College and later at the Royal College of Art in London. Bursting onto the scene at the Young Contemporaries exhibition, Hockney was quickly heralded as the golden boy of postwar British art and a leading proponent of pop art. It was during the swinging 60s in London that he befriended many of the seminal cultural figures of the generation and throughout these years Hockney's career grew. Always absorbed in his work, he drew, painted and etched for long hours each day, but it was a scholarship that led him to California, where he painted his iconic series of swimming pools. Since then, the most prestigious galleries across the world have devoted countless shows to his extraordinary work.<br><br>In the seventies he expanded his range of projects, including set and costume design for operas and experiments with photography, lithography, and even photocopying. Most recently he has been at the forefront the art world's digital revolution, producing incredible sketches on his iPhone and iPad, and it is this progressive thinking which has highlighted his genius, vigor and versatility as an artist approaching his 75th birthday.<br><br>In this, the first volume of Hockney&#x2019;s biography, detailing his life and work from 1937 - 1975, Sykes explores the fascinating world of the beloved and controversial artist whose career has spanned and epitomized the art movements of the last five decades.<br><br>"The timing couldn't be better for this enjoyable and well-sourced book, which &#x2014; like Hockney's own work &#x2014; is both conversational and perceptive." &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times<br></i><br>"To read Christopher Simon Sykes' <i>David Hockney</i> is to marvel at the artistic gifts of the eccentric Yorkshireman who rose from a sometimes pinched childhood to hobnob with poet Stephen Spender and novelist Christopher Isherwood, to party with Mick Jagger and Manolo Blahnik." &#x2014;<i>The Plain Dealer</i><br><br>"Prodigiously entertaining." &#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;A chatty, knowledgeable, insider's biography, full of anecdotes.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p></p><p>CHRISTOPHER SIMON SYKES is a photographer and writer.

Fletcher paints a vibrant picture of mid-twentieth-century New York and the ways in which its indigenous art, theater, literature, and political movements converged to create such unique music.<br><br> With great attention to the colorful characters behind the sounds, from trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie to Tito Puente, Bob Dylan, and the Ramones, he takes us through bebop, the Latin music scene, the folk revival, glitter music, disco, punk, and hip-hop as they emerged from the neighborhood streets of Harlem, the East and West Village, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens. All the while, Fletcher goes well beyond the history of the music to explain just what it was about these distinctive New York sounds that took the entire nation by storm. 33 photos</p><p><b>Tony Fletcher</b> is the author of six non-fiction books and one novel.

For a number of families, that dream has been realized in the glorious chateaux of France. Though visitors and armchair travelers delight in chateau architecture, they seldom see the private side of chateau life: how the French live day-to-day in their marvelous buildings. These stately residences are not dusty uninhabited museums, but real homes. Christiane de Nicolay-Mazery, herself born and brought up in her family&#39;s magnificent property at Montfort-le-Rotrou, takes us across France to visit the great homes she knows so well, opening doors that are usually closed to the outside world and allowing an intimate view of the unique way of life that goes on through the seasons. In the spring we attend a wedding at the Chateau de Groussay, and we see the drawing rooms, bedrooms, greenhouse, and orangery at Le Lude in the company of the Comtesse de Nicolay. In summer we visit the Chateau d&#39;Haroue in Lorraine as guests of the Princesse de Beauvau-Craon. In autumn we follow the hunt with the Marquis and Marquise de Brissac, returning to the Chateau de Brissac for dinner. Baron Eric de Rothschild opens his cellars to us at Chateau Lafite. The onset of winter is celebrated with a boar hunt at the Chateau de Courances and lunch in the forest in the company of the Marquis and Marquise de Ganay.

We have seen age only as decline. In this powerful and very personal book, Betty Friedan charted her own voyage of discovery, and that of others, into a different kind of aging. <p> Friedan found ordinary men and women, moving into their fifties, sixties, seventies, discovering extraordinary new possibilities of intimacy and purpose. In their surprising experiences, Friedan first glimpsed, then embraced, the idea that one can grow and evolve throughout life in a style that dramatically mitigates the expectation of decline and opens the way to a further dimension of "personhood." </p><p> <i>The Fountain of Age</i> suggests new possibilities for every one of us, all founded on a solid body of startling but little-known scientific evidence. It demolishes those myths that have constrained us for too long and offers compelling alternatives for living one's age as a unique, exuberant time of life, on its own authentic terms.</p></p><p>A founder of NOW and a vanguard leader of the Women's Movement, <b>Betty Friedan</b> was the author of <i>The Feminine Mystique, It Changed My Life, The Second Stage, Beyond Gender,</i> and <i>The Fountain of Age.</i> She taught at Northwestern University, Yale, Temple, Harvard, and USC.

Read by Friedan herself, The Fountain of Age, &#34;glimpses new possibilities and new directions&#34; for aging in both men and women. Friedan&#39;s distinctive, gravelly voice lends itself well to her writing style. The pace at times seems slow, but Friedan&#39;s voice is expressive.

Hailed for prose that is "full of beauty and vigor and bite" (<em>The New York Times</em>), it is perhaps the finest example of nature writing since Thoreau's <em>Walden</em>. <br> Now this classic work is available in a completely redesigned and lavishly illustrated gift edition, featuring over one hundred beautiful full-color pictures by Michael Sewell, one of the country's leading nature photographers. Sewell, whose work has graced the pages of <em>Audubon</em> and <em>Sierra</em> magazines, walked Leopold's property in Wisconsin and shot these photographs specifically for this edition, allowing readers to see Sand County as Leopold saw it. The resulting layout is spectacular. But the heart of the book remains Leopold's carefully rendered observations of nature. Here we follow Leopold throughout the year, from January to December, as he walks about the rural Wisconsin landscape, watching a woodcock dance skyward in golden afternoon light, or spying a rough-legged hawk dropping like a feathered bomb on its prey. And perhaps most important are Leopold's trenchant comments throughout the book on our abuse of the land and on what we must do to preserve this invaluable treasure. This edition also includes two of Leopold's most eloquent essays on conservation, "The Land Ethic" and "Marshland Elegy." <br> With this gift edition of <em>A Sand County Almanac</em>, a new generation of readers can walk beside one of America's most respected naturalists as he conveys the beauty of a marsh before sunrise or the wealth of history to be found in an ancient oak.<br></p><p>Published in 1949, shortly after the author's death, <i>A Sand County Almanac</i> is a classic of nature writing, widely cited as one of the most influential nature books ever published. Writing from the vantage of his summer shack along the banks of the Wisconsin River, Leopold mixes essay, polemic, and memoir in his book's pages. In one famous episode, he writes of killing a female wolf early in his career as a forest ranger, coming upon his victim just as she was dying, "in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes.... I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view." Leopold's road-to-Damascus change of view would find its fruit some years later in his so-called land ethic, in which he held that nothing that disturbs the balance of nature is right. Much of <i>Almanac</i> elaborates on this basic premise, as well as on Leopold's view that it is something of a human duty to preserve as much wild land as possible, as a kind of bank for the biological future of all species. Beautifully written, quiet, and elegant, Leopold's book deserves continued study and discussion today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>A profoundly affecting work.

The radio was playing the Ventures' hit "Walk Don't Run." <br><br>I sat in the front seat with my father while my mother sat in the back with Willie, the world's most stupid dog. We were following the orange Allied moving van, and I kept rereading the motto on the back door: leave the worrying to us. Two tall steel exhaust pipes rose in the air like minarets from both sides of the truck's cabin. Each had a flap that continually flipped open, belching black smoke and then snapping shut, like the mouth of Ollie, the dragon handpuppet on the <i>Kukla, Fran and Ollie </i>television show. The smoke mouths kept repeating the same phrase in unison: <i>It's all your fault . . . it's all your fault.<br><br></i>I pressed my face to the window as the car crawled up the hill in first gear. Lewiston, where I'd grown up, was slowly receding. The town was nestled against the rock cliff of the huge escarpment on one side and bordered by the Niagara River on the other. St. Peter's Catholic church spire, which cast such a huge shadow when you were in the town, was barely visible from up here.<br><br>The sun was resting on the limestone cliff, setting it ablaze. I squinted at the orange embers on the rock wall, but the reflection was so glaring, I had to look away. My childhood too had gone up in flames.<br><br>~~<br><br>Yesterday I'd stood for the last time in my large bedroom with its wide-plank floor and blue toile wallpaper. My bed, which had been in my family for over 150 years, was now stripped naked, dismantled and propped against the wall. It was going to be left behind in our heritage home, no longer part of my heritage. My father said that the ceilings in our new house would not be high enough for the canopy. Where were we moving&#x2013;a chicken coop?<br><br>I looked out my window at our sprawling yard and counted for the last time the thirteen old oak trees my ancestors had planted to celebrate the thirteen states in the union. The dozens of peony bushes near the wraparound porch had just opened. For generations now the church had taken flowers from our expansive gardens for the altar. I loved the part of the Mass when Father Flanagan would say, "Today's altar flowers are donated to the glory of God by the McClures."<br><br>As I loaded my new popcorn bobby socks into a box with my Lollipop underpants and turtleneck dickeys, I caught an unwelcome glimpse of myself in the mirror behind my door. I was twelve and very tall for my age, with white-blonde hair. I had no curves, not even in my calves. I resembled a Q-tip. When I'd told my mother I was hideous, she insisted that the early teenage years were an "awkward stage" and that soon I would "grow into myself"&#x2013;whatever that meant.<br><br>I took a gilt-framed picture of my parents off my marble-topped dresser. It was an old photo of my father in his wool three-piece suit with his broad letterman grin, his arm casually draped around my lovely tall mother with her shy smile. It was taken years before I was born. Suddenly the words I'd overheard Delores, the cleaning lady, say to someone yesterday over the phone came back to me. She claimed it was a good thing that my mother only had one child, because two like me would have put her "in an early grave." As I glanced at the picture one more time before wrapping it in my eyelet slip, I realized how much my parents, who were in their forties when they had me, had aged. They now looked more like grandparents than parents.<br><br>~~<br><br>As the car chugged toward the top of the escarpment, I, like Lot's wife, looked back at the town below me. I had no idea then that I was leaving behind the least-troubled years of my life. Strange, since I felt there was no way I could cause more trouble than I'd caused in Lewiston.<br><br>It was 1960. We were doing what millions of other people had done: we were migrating. The Okies had left the Dust Bowl for water and we were leaving Lewiston for what my mother had mysteriously described as "opportunities." Whatever the reason, we were leaving behind the chunk of rock that was a part of us.<br><br>What would I do in Buffalo in the summer heat? When I was working at my dad' s store in Niagara Falls, I would wander over to the falls and get cooled off by the spray. I couldn't imagine not being near the rising clouds of mist that parted to reveal the perpetually optimistic rainbow.<br><br>What would my life be without the falls to ground me? Losing the falls was bad enough, but how could I leave the small, idyllic town of Lewiston, where history was around every corner? General Brock had been billeted in our house during the war of 1812. Our basement had been part of the Underground Railroad that smuggled black slaves to Canada. And would I ever again live somewhere where everyone knew me&#x2013; where I knew who I was? I would no longer be the little girl who worked in her dad's drugstore. Roy, the delivery driver with whom I distributed drugs all over the Niagara Frontier, used to say if someone in Lewiston didn't know us, then they were "drifters."<br><br>~~<br><br>Soon the escarpment was only a line in the distance, and Lewiston had disappeared. I would always remember it frozen in time: the uneven bricks of Center Street under my feet; the old train track up the middle, worn down after not being used for almost a century; The Frontier House, the hotel where Dickens, James Fenimore Cooper and Lafayette stayed and the word <i>cocktail </i>was invented; the maple and elm trees that arched over the roads, and the Niagara River, with its swirling blue waters that snaked along the edge of town.<br><br>As we began to head south, I thought about the tightrope walker my mother and I had seen, years ago, inching across Niagara Falls carrying a long balance pole. We stood below on the lip of the escarpment, holding our breath. My mother kept her eyes shut and made me tell her what was happening.<br><br>I felt as though now, as I headed into my teenage years, it would take all I had to maintain my balance. I knew the secret was to never look down at the whirlpools below, to focus on a fixed point at eye level and keep moving. I had no idea then how much I would teeter when the winds of change in the 1960s got blowing.<br><br>My father swung the car onto a new divided highway that looked like a construction site with mounds of dirt by the side of the road The journey had become so boring that I actually started listening to my parents' conversation. Sometimes I forgot that they too were moving to a new city and a new home. I tuned in just as my father was saying, "I know it is far less money, but when I looked up the census, I found that the average salary for 1960 is only between four and five thousand dollars."<br><br>"No one earns the average salary," my mother said.<br><br>This comment worried me because my mother was always unfailingly supportive of my father. No matter what he did, she acted like it was a stroke of genius and she was delighted to be part of the arrangement. I had never before felt tension between them. Suddenly it was as though someone had vacuum-packed the car.<br><br>In an effort to regain some air, I blurted out, "Are we moving because of me?"<br><br>"No," my mother said.<br><br>My father remained silent and pressed in the lighter to reignite his El Producto cigar, which was starting to make me carsick. He looked in the rearview mirror at my mother, sending her a glance with an arched eyebrow. Clearly he disagreed with her.<br><br>She said, "Well, it <i>is </i>true that we think you would be happier in a larger place. The world seems to be aching to change a bit . . . and Lewiston is having growing pains."<br><br>"Change? What needs to change?" I asked.<br><br>"I don't mean change exactly; I just think we all need a broader scope," she said. "Different kinds of people&#x2013; looking out at the world instead of closing the world out."<br><br>My father was still looking in the rear-view mirror, and although he barely moved a muscle, I could tell he was shocked that my mother was saying such things. He had no idea what in my mother' s world could possibly need broadening.<br><br>When my father had announced the move, he said we were going for "new business prospects." He said that the economy had changed and that pretty soon there wouldn't be any more small, family-run drugstores. I had never thought our drugstore was small&#x2013; I thought of it as enormous. He maintained that the world was being taken over by "chain stores." I didn't know what these were; I thought at first that he meant hardware stores that sold shackles. He explained how chain stores worked out better prices from the drug companies, how they didn' t make specialty unguents and didn't deliver. Most of the work was done by pharmacy assistants. He could no longer compete; it was time to get out before we were forced out.<br><br>Did he really think these chain-type-stores would catch on? Had he forgotten about loyalty? I thought of all the times Roy and I had risked our lives delivering medication on roads with blowing snow and black ice, or worked after midnight to get someone insulin. It was my father who always said that customers would appreciate the service and be loyal. But just days ago, when I'd questioned him on this, he said that people could be fickle and that their loyalty was to the almighty dollar. All the service in the world couldn't keep a customer if Aspirin is cheaper elsewhere.<br><br>When I said that was terribly unfair, he pointed out that that was just human nature. People did what was best for themselves at any given time. I'd never heard him speak so harshly. He'd usually espoused kindness and "going the extra mile." He put his arm around me and said that the world was changing and it was best to move on. You couldn't stop progress. After all, America hailed the Model T; no one cried for the blacksmith.<br><br>As we drove along the ugly, detour highway, weaving between gigantic rust-coloured generators that obscured the view of the rock cliffs and the river, I asked why, since we must be getting near the city of Niagara Falls, we didn't see the silver mist of the falls spraying in the air like a geyser. My father told me the highway we were on was being built by Robert Moses (who would coincidentally name it the Robert Moses Parkway, though I never saw a park). Moses designed it so that tourists would be diverted from the downtown core of Niagara Falls and forced to drive by his monument of progress, the Niagara Power Project. No one would drive through the heart of Niagara Falls any more, which is where our drugstore was. My father predicted, accurately as it turned out, that the downtown would soon die.<br><br>~~<br><br>After about a half-hour, my father circled off the New York State Thruway onto a futuristic round basket-weave exit marked Amherst. "Wait until you see how convenient this home is for getting on the highway and travelling," he said.<br><br>I wondered where we would be going since my father said travelling spread disease.<br><br>A minute later he swung into a suburban housing development with a sign that read kingsgate village, and then onto Pearce Drive. When he turned into a driveway, I was too taken aback to say anything. In front of us was a tiny green clapboard bungalow with pink trim. All around it were identical houses with slightly different frontispieces. My father had picked out this place, but I felt his mortification at having to show it to us. It started to sink in that our historical colonial home with the huge wraparound porch was now history.<br><br>Why my mother had not been included in the house hunt was a mystery to me. It wasn't like she was busy. She'd never in my memory cooked, cleaned or held a job.<br><br>She was trying to find nice things to say. "Well, this should be easy to look after. No big yard to rake."<br><br>But I could feel her slowly withering, cell by disappointed cell.<br><br>A man in the next yard, which was hard to distinguish from our toupï¿½e of green turf, was outside cutting the lawn in his tank-style undershirt. Suspenders held up his pants, forming a kind of empire waistline directly under his surprisingly large breasts. He waved and said, "Howdy."<br><br>"Who is that&#x2013; Humpty Dumpty?" I asked.<br><br>My mother shot me a look that said it was best not to make fun of anyone who would be our neighbour in what was to be our neighbourhood.<br><br>We got out of the car and I stood in the driveway, peering inside through the kitchen window. The floor had linoleum with a design of faux pebbles, the kind that would surround the moat if you lived next door to Sir Lancelot. The walls were covered in fake brick contact paper with fake ivy growing up it.<br><br>The moving van pulled up. As one mover chomped on a hoagie, the other jumped down from the cab, looked at the house and said to my father, "There's no way you are ever going to fit these huge pieces of furniture into this place. What am I supposed to do with them?" The front door was obviously too narrow for the French armoires and early American dressers.<br><br>My father said nothing. I had never seen him look as though he was not in charge. He just went and sat on the porch, which was actually a cement stoop. My mother, who'd inherited these antiques and cherished them, ordered the movers to unload everything onto the driveway. Then she said to my father, "Not to worry, Jim. Some of these things have been in my family for far too long. It's progress&#x2013;we'll clear out some of it&#x2013; deadwood."<br><br>I braced myself and followed my parents inside. My room was tiny, and now I knew why my father had said I couldn't bring my canopy bed. A single bed could barely fit in this cubbyhole. It was the size of my walk-in closet in Lewiston. Cheap cotton curtains printed with faded red Chinese pagodas adorned two small sliding aluminum windows that were too high to see out of. Since there was nothing else to look at, I went back to the living room, where my mother stood looking lost while my father was in the bathroom. Even with the door closed we heard everything, as though we were standing next to him. I just stared at the floor and so did my mother.<br><br>During the move the men broke a silver and marble ashtray, the kind that stood by an easy chair and opened like a yawn to swallow still-smouldering butts. My father said, "You'll pay for that. I' m making out a report on it right now and I'll be sure to mention your lack of care." It was unlike my father to get rattled and speak to people in an impolite tone.<br><br>Later, in the driveway, I overheard one mover, who wore his disdain in his every gesture, say to his partner, "The guy's worried about his precious ashtray?"<br><br>The other said, "He told me this place is just a stopover till his new split-level is finished."<br><br>The movers exchanged glances.<br><br>Once the weensy rooms were filled, my father, bewildered, stared at the ocean of antiques in the driveway. He said to my mother, "When I saw this place it was empty. I don't remember it being so small." <br><br>My mother refused to watch as the movers hoisted the furniture into the attic of the garage.

Rozan now owns a coveted Anthony Award for Best Novel for her No Colder Place. The Washington Post has called her Bill Smith/Lydia Chin novels &#x201c;a series to watch for.&#x201d; Booklist deemed Rozan &#x201c;a major figure in contemporary mystery fiction.&#x201d; Now it's your turn-- to discover one of fiction's major voices and to fall in love with a mystery of evocative atmosphere, engaging characters, and exquisite writing. <br><br>It's Lydia Chin's turn to go underground as the Chinese-American P.I. investigates a case that strikes at the heart of Chinatown's dangerously shifting power structure. Four restaurant workers, including a union organizer, have disappeared, and the union's lawyer hires Lydia to find them. But when a bomb shatters the Chinese Restaurant Workers' Union headquarters, killing one of the missing men and injuring the lawyer, Lydia is summoned by the prime suspect, one of Chinatown's most powerful men, to continue the search--on his payroll. With backup from her partner Bill Smith, Lydia goes undercover as a dim sum waitress, slinging steamed dumplings while dodging a lethal conflict between the old and the new orders, and searching for the missing waiters and their deadly secret--before someone serves them their last supper...<br></p><p>There's lots of action, great food, and social insight into the attitudes of various generations of immigrants in S.J. Rozan's fifth book in her superlative Lydia Chin-Bill Smith series. There's also a remarkable moment when Lydia's mother actually admits that she approves of the way her daughter does her job. Mrs. Chin has always hated the fact that Lydia's work as a private detective puts her in danger and in the company of men, like Smith, who don't make suitable husbands. But when Lydia refuses to knuckle under to the demands of a venerable Chinatown patriarch, her mother astonishes her (and us) by praising her "professional manner"--and then goes on to give her a clue that helps her unravel a mystery involving the smuggling of people and drugs. With each novel, Rozan alternates the narrative focus between Lydia Chin and Bill Smith, and this time it's Lydia's turn to take center stage. She uses her ethnicity and acting talent to work undercover as a dim sum waitress at the Dragon Garden (where four illegal aliens have disappeared) and her deep roots in New York's Chinatown to note and comment on subtle changes in the power structure as new Fukienese-speaking immigrants replace the old Cantonese. She and Smith also move their complicated personal relationship forward a notch and consume vast amounts of wonderful food--Chinese, Jewish, even a homemade meatloaf--in a story that manages to satisify all the senses.

Brian Phillips Murphy follows the collaborations between political leaders and a group of unelected political entrepreneurs, including Robert R. Livingston and Alexander Hamilton, who persuaded legislative powers to grant monopolies corporate status in order to finance and manage civic institutions. Murphy shows how American capitalism grew out of the convergence of political and economic interests, wherein political culture was shaped by business strategies and institutions as much as the reverse.</p><p>Focusing on the state of New York, a onetime mercantile colony that became home to the first American banks, utilities, canals, and transportation infrastructure projects, <i>Building the Empire State</i> surveys the changing institutional ecology during the first five decades following the American Revolution. Through sustained attention to the Manhattan Company, the steamboat monopoly, the Erie Canal, and the New York &amp; Erie Railroad, Murphy traces the ways entrepreneurs marshaled political and financial capital to sway legislators to support their private plans and interests. By playing a central role in the creation and regulation of institutions that facilitated private commercial transactions, New York State's political officials created formal and informal precedents for the political economy throughout the northeastern United States and toward the expanding westward frontier. The political, economic, and legal consequences organizing the marketplace in this way continue to be felt in the vast influence and privileged position held by corporations in the present day.</p></p><p>Brian Phillips Murphy teaches history at Baruch College.<p>Introduction<br>Strength in Structure</p><p>One late spring day in Manhattan in 1784, Robert Robert Livingston Jr. did something he and his peers did nearly every day of their adult lives: he sat down, pulled out a sheaf of paper, and began scribbling.</p><p>For the past seven years, the 37-year-old aristocrat had been New York State's chancellor, one of its top judicial officials. The position had been created under a new state constitution New York adopted in 1777 after the separation from Great Britain. Livingston coauthored that document and all but inherited the newly created post; his late father, Robert R. "Judge" Livingston Sr. had also been a prominent jurist and politician in colonial New York.</p><p>Politics was one of the Livingston family's businesses, and Robert Junior had long been busy at the center of the politics of Revolution. In 1775 he became a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, and in 1776 he was one-fifth of the Committee of Five tasked with drawing up a Declaration of Independence. He returned to New York to frame that state's 1777 constitution, was named the state's chancellor by a provisional governing body, and left again in 1781 to serve as his country's first secretary of foreign affairs, its senior-most diplomatic official.</p><p>But now all of that was in the past.</p><p>As the national capital ambled from Philadelphia to Princeton to Annapolis, the center of its politics drifted further and further from Livingston's reach and from New York itself, where the Livingston name&#x2014;one that had dominated colonial politics for a century&#x2014;seemed to be at a nadir. In the New York legislature, some of the Revolution's leaders, whom the chancellor had labeled "warm &amp; hotheaded Whigs," seemed determined to permanently keep men like him from wielding anything like his former power. Having come under fire for being an absentee state officeholder, Livingston resigned his foreign affairs post in 1783 and returned home to mend ties in New York. He spent months battling the allegation by the Whigs that he had in fact vacated the office of chancellor once he began serving in Congress. Even after that controversy quieted, a smaller contingent of legislators pestered the chancellor by proposing to cut his ï¿½400 salary in half while debating a bill that gave raises to the governor and every other judge in the state.</p><p>Livingston quietly began plotting his recovery by falling back on a playbook his family had (successfully) used for generations: rebuilding his political capital by rebuilding his financial capital. As a political entrepreneur descended from several generations of political entrepreneurs&#x2014;people who sought to translate their influence and connections into sources of income and opportunity&#x2014;Livingston was used to living in a state where the official apparatus of government was his collaborative and encouraging partner, aiding his enterprises and giving a boost to his personal ambitions and those he had for the civic well-being of New York City. The animating energy of colonial government had long come from collaborations between official entities and local private interests. In Livingston's mind, the propriety of that relationship had in no way been discredited by the Revolution. Restoring those pre-Revolutionary practices would favor Livingston's family and others with capital to invest and influence to exercise, and for the next thirty years Robert Livingston planned and profited from political-economy practices he helped set.</p><p>During the fall of 1783, Livingston began spending money and political capital to reestablish both the city of New York and his footing within it. He began enticing friends and associates to join him in buying houses and estates vacated during the war or abandoned by Tory Loyalists who had fled the country. Livingston had already invested ï¿½2,800 in such properties and was seeking a credit line of ï¿½8,000 to plunge even deeper into the venture. At the same time, he was assembling a portfolio of associates to cofound a so-called land bank where such real estate holdings could be mortgaged for paper money.</p><p>What frustrated Robert Livingston enough to decry the city's "notorious" greed in early 1784 was that the official apparatus of New York's government&#x2014;both its state legislature and the city corporation governing New York City through an appointed mayor and an elected board of aldermen&#x2014;was not reciprocating. As he read newspaper articles about other states' willingness to use incorporation grants to harness civic energy and mobilize private capital, Livingston saw New York failing to support the ambitions he and other New Yorkers harbored for their city and state. His bid for a bank charter was stalled in the state legislature, and New York's municipal government seemed to be immobilized and subject to the whims of petty entrenched interests looking to preserve their own narrow privileges at the expense of others.</p><p>Pouring his angst onto four long, narrow ledger-sized sheets of laid cotton paper&#x2014;the kind lawyers used for formal court filings and Livingston used for everything&#x2014;the chancellor fumed that "since the peace, a rage has prevailed in the neighboring states for corporations" that "annex ideas of utility to them." But in New York "we have not been so fortunate." Although "the fire" of 1776 "left open a door for improvement" and history had provided London's 1666 singe as a model for what an active and ambitious city government could do under such circumstances, New Yorkers refused to "[do] things themselves or [avail] themselves of the spirit of enterprise that the war has left with us."</p><p>According to the chancellor, New York City's government had become incapable of following through on even basic tasks. New Yorkers had gotten good at "[projecting] useful schemes for posterity to carry into effect," the chancellor wrote. Streets that should have been repaired for "the health &amp; embellishment of the town" had instead become "the abode of verb &amp; excuses." The city corporation had planned to plant trees that would re-create the "cool &amp; shady walks" New Yorkers had enjoyed before the war. With the planting season nearly over, however, the chancellor marveled, "[N]o step has yet been taken." "Even this shadowy improvement," he predicted, "is liable to cheat our hopes." A "scheme," Livingston reflected, "is extinguished with the same rapidity that it was embraced." "Half a dozen old women" could arrest work on a project by merely "scold[ing] . . . the profanity" entailed in "[exposing] dark recesses of stone street . . . to publick view."</p><p>Livingston thought city leaders had been cowed into inaction by incumbent interests and entrenched monopolists who were "too powerful for the rest of the citizens" to defeat. The influence of these forces, Livingston believed, distorted the city's political economy and marketplace to the detriment of consumer-citizens. Spoiled bread flour that should have been "held up to public view" by a regime of city-appointed inspectors was instead being sold to unsuspecting buyers, all to keep "the customs of our ancestors, encourage luxury, and discourage . . . the sale of unmarketable flour." An abundance of fresh water that could have provided "comfortable refreshments" to residents while "guard[ing] us against the alarming ravages of fire" was instead unavailable&#x2014;all because the proprietors of a spring-fed well called the "Tea-Water Pump" stood in the way. "It is a notorious fact," he wrote, "that the greed of this city is worse than that of any other place upon the continent." "[A]las we have little hope to expect," Livingston sighed, that such an improvement "will be crowned with [success] while there are tea-water men, and tea-water women &amp; tea-water children" insisting they alone had gained in 1757 the permanent and exclusive right to supply the city with water for all time. As long as their government refused to challenge the status quo, New Yorkers would be left with no choice than to be "tormented from seeing the cup glide by them after it was brought to their chins," destined "neither to eat or drink like other folk." "It is our common reproach to want bread and water" even though "the means of obtaining both are in our power." The only public project New Yorkers could truly be proud of, Livingston bitterly concluded, was the city's decades-old gallows. They were "distinguished," he noted, by their strength, and were "in the word[s] of Hamlet's grave digger, built stronger than the carpenter or mason."</p><p>In his lifetime, Robert Livingston sent thousands of letters and published nearly a dozen widely read essays. This, however, was not one of them.</p><p>There is no indication that Livingston returned to this essay or revised it or that it was ever sent&#x2014;to anyone. One of Livingston's biographers linked it to another letter sent to New York City mayor James Duane&#x2014;the husband of one of the chancellor's cousins. But that missive is mocking and mischievous in tone, clearly intended to irk the mayor. That letter was a bridge-burner that flayed both the city's political leadership and the public alike and was originally written for publication in a newspaper. It was an essay written at a moment when, in a bitter letter to his friend John Jay, the chancellor said he had "concluded my political career."</p><p>Livingston might have simply wanted to spare his family embarrassment or shield himself from this momentary departure from rhetorical elegance. However, his statement to Jay about having "concluded" his political life cries out for further scrutiny. By what measure could Livingston credibly claim to be exiting politics? It certainly would have surprised New York State's legal and political community to learn that their sitting chancellor considered himself retired, particularly when his daily actions and ongoing engagements plainly contradicted this statement. As a man raised in the innermost circles of New York politics during British dominion, Livingston was clearly irritated and even disturbed by his state's postwar politics during these first years of American independence now called the Critical Period.</p><p>The Revolution fundamentally challenged the colonial status quo, empowering people who wanted to deny former colonial aristocrats the chance to return to their positions at the top of the new nation's political and socioeconomic ladders. Some ideological imperatives, therefore, demanded that Robert Livingston feel frustrated in 1784, and a cadre of state legislators stood ready to make his political life as difficult as possible. Livingston's reaction was evidence of just how unfamiliar, at least to him, this new environment had become. He remained determined, however, to turn his lands, money, connections, and family name into sources of profit and influence&#x2014;not as an aristocrat but as a political entrepreneur.</p><p>Yet the chancellor was all too aware that not every New Yorker with capital was committed to the same agenda. When the chancellor railed against the "notorious fact" of the "greed of [New York City]," he was drawing a contrast between himself and others who sought privileges in the political marketplace. Livingston saw himself as a positive force in his country's politics. Profit was just one of several reasons he was interested in banking and real estate investing, activities that he viewed as constructive contributions toward the commercial success and political stability of his state. The marketplace regulations and interventions he desired&#x2014;flour inspections, freshwater supplies, street paving, tree planting&#x2014;had long been permissible and even definitional duties of municipal governments that had been constituted under a royal charter, operated within common law, and rechartered following independence.</p><p>Although localities, states, and the developing national confederation had adopted formal articles and constitutions, the nation's actual day-to-day governing habits&#x2014;its <i>applied</i> political economy&#x2014;were still up for grabs at this moment in American history. In New York, as in the nation, the proper extent of the state's mixed economy of public-private enterprises had hardly been debated, let alone defined. The ideological imperatives of the Revolution were competing with familiar practices of pre-Revolutionary governance, and although some lawmakers wanted to further exploit their opportunity to effect social and economic change, others sought to settle the Revolution as soon as possible. The state government, Livingston told Robert Morris, was "weak, unsettled." The monopoly-holders of the Tea-Water Pump and deceitful flour merchants were fine with that and with exploiting a lack of competition in the political marketplace to wring profits from an already anemic economy. To Livingston, their greed was parasitic, and the city government's inaction amounted to a betrayal of the Revolution's "spirit of enterprise" that was to be "encourage[d] . . . in others." Livingston's essay, therefore, did not merely address a personal agenda; the larger question hovering over his words and the country as a whole in 1784 was: What happens now?</p><p><i>Political economy</i> is a well-defined term in American history: the way that states and governments ordered the economy and operated within the marketplace. As much as is known about it in theory, however, less is understood about the interactions among legal and extralegal voluntary associations, chartered and informal institutions, and political officials with backgrounds and futures in commercial and transportation development. But these ground-level machinations, complex and often messy, are what political economy <i>is</i> once it is operationalized.</p><p><i>Building the Empire State</i> surveys and samples the changing institutional ecology of New York State during the first five decades following independence, a period my fellow historians call the early republic, by following a community of entrepreneurs like Robert R. Livingston, and their enterprises. New York was a onetime mercantile colony that, as a state, became home to the first bank incorporated after the Revolution (the Bank of New-York), utilities, canals, railroads, and other internal improvement companies, as well as the country's most powerful steamboat monopoly and the largest public works project of the early republic: the Erie Canal. Within this geographical context, this book investigates political economy in practice: I ask how ideas and ideologies gave way to actions and policies, and I explore the political, economic, and legal consequences of chartering particular institutions and organizing the marketplace in certain ways. In this period, New York's state government was busy opening avenues for profit and influence to its citizens, prompting them to organize and mobilize as economic interests in order to take advantage of these opportunities. By asserting authority in creating and regulating institutions that facilitated and intermediated private commercial transactions throughout the northeastern United States and toward the expanding westward frontier, New York's political officials set the formal rules of the game and defined the informal norms of behavior in one of the nation's busiest commercial centers and largest economies, demonstrating that "the state" was one of the primary agents of change in the early republi...</p></p><h2>Martin Kippenberger: The Problem Perspective</h2><p><p>Works spanning the legendary and prolific artist's twenty-year career, including many of his self-portraits, paintings, sculptures, works on paper, installations, and exhibition posters.</p></p><p><p>Martin Kippenberger (1953-1997) is a special case in art. His life and works were inextricably linked in a remarkable practice that centered on the role of the artist within both the culture and the system of art. With his larger-than-life persona, Kippenberger cast himself as impresario, entertainer, curator, bohemian, collector, architect, and publisher. He collected art, set up clothing companies and nightclubs, and ran art-world scams. Nothing was sacred to this iconoclast except the right to satisfy his enormous appetite for life, appropriate anything for his art, and create continual chaos around himself. This book, which accompanies the first major U.S. retrospective exhibition of Kippenberger's work, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, documents Kippenberger's extraordinary twenty-year career with works in many media--paintings, sculptures, works on paper, installations, photographs, collaborations with other artists, posters, postcards, books, and music. Among the major works reproduced are key selections from the I.N.P. Bilder (Is Not Embarrassing Pictures) and No Problem paintings of the 1980s; the landmark 1987 exhibition of sculpture "Peter. Die russische Stellung" ("Peter. The Russian Position"); self-portraits in a variety of media; Laterne an Betrunkene (Street Lamp for Drunks); the Raft of the Medusa cycle of the 1990s; the renowned Hotel drawings; and the monumental installation, The Happy End of Franz Kafka's "Amerika." Accompanying the artworks is an essay by exhibition curator Ann Goldstein; newly commissioned texts by art historian Pamela Lee, Kippenberger scholar Diedrich Diederichsen, and curator Ann Temkin; reprinted excerpts from a 1991 interview with Kippenberger by artist Jutta Koether; and an illustrated exhibition history, chronology, and bibliography. Martin Kippenberger: The Problem Perspective offers readers the most comprehensive view yet of this legendary artist's body of work.</p></p><h2>Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</h2><p>Using firsthand documents, the author recounts the trial of Nazi officials at Nuremberg, analyzing the day-to-day struggles among the prosecutors and judges, the evidence of unprecedented atrocities, and the personalities of the accused. 35,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p><b>Joseph E. Persico</b>&nbsp;was the author of&nbsp;<i>Roosevelt&#x2019;s Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage</i>;<i> Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour: Armistice Day, 1918&#x2013;World War I and Its Violent Climax</i>;&nbsp;<i>Piercing the Reich</i>;&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</i>,&nbsp;which was made into a television docudrama. He also collaborated with Colin Powell on his autobiography,&nbsp;<i>My American Journey</i>. Persico died in 2014.Most books about the Nuremberg trials have focused on the jurisprudential aspects of this unprecedented event. Persico (Casey, 1990; Edward R. Murrow, 1988; etc.) has chosen to write an overview that offers a picture of the comparatively underreported battles behind the judgments. Persico traces the history of the war crimes tribunal, from the waning days of the war, when Churchill was calling for drumhead court-martials and summary executions. Truman wanted a legal proceeding that would show the world that Nazi barbarism was the exception, not the rule, and would make an example of the most heinous perpetrators. But would the result be victors' justice or the real thing? Throughout the several months from the time the idea was hatched to the execution of sentence, there raged a series of behind-the-scenes struggles. Within the prosecution, there were turf wars over who would take the lead in examining witnesses, over which of the four participating powers--the US, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union--would carry the most weight, and over genuine differences of opinion as to what kind of prosecution would be most effective. Among the defendants, there were numerous factions, with the supremely cynical anad evil Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering emerging as a dominant figure. Drawing on interviews with many participants who have never spoken of their experiences for publication, Persico delineates the personal clashes (Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, the head of the US prosecution team, vs. former attorney general Francis Biddle, the US judge; a duel between the prison psychiatrist and psychologist over who would publish a book first), often at the expense of the courtroom action. Gradually the focus on the out-of-sight nastiness among the Allies becomes numbing and unpleasant, and the book is most lively when it shifts its attention back to the proceedings themselves. Nuremberg has an undeniable timeliness, especially in light of the new wave of Holocaust deniers. Persico writes well, despite occasionally drifting into melodrama, and the subject exerts its own fascination. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She has taught courses in Asian art at Temple University, Parsons School of Design, Columbia University, and The City College of New York.Since the ninth century, students of Zen Buddhism have drawn a parallel between the individual path to enlightenment and the story of the herder and his missing ox. There are 10 stages in the parable, beginning with the search for the ox, in which a boy is racked with doubt because "Nothing has been lost in the first place,/ So what is the use of searching?" In the final stage, the boy reappears as the Buddha of the Future, enlightened. The scroll reprinted here is the oldest known version of the Japanese Ten Oxherding Songs, dating to 1278, and the only known example with illustrations in color along with the calligraphy. An introduction by Stephanie Wada, associate curator of the Mary and Jackson Burke foundation (which holds the manuscript) explains, in scholarly terms, both the story and the origins of this scroll and its ten circular drawings (one for each song) and poems. Nothing she writes, however, can have the impact of the eighth part of the parable: with just a wide, empty circle from which both the boy and the ox have vanished, this stage indicates that the attachment to "self" and earthly things has been relinquished. The delicacy and unstudied precision of the calligraphy's brushwork furthers the feeling. Even a Zen novice can appreciate the message of this parable, lovingly inked more than 700 years ago.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black, Brown, &amp; Beige: Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (Surrealist Revolution Series)</h2><p><p>Surrealism as a movement has always resisted the efforts of critics to confine it to any static definition&#x2014;surrealists themselves have always preferred to speak of it in terms of dynamics, dialectics, goals, and struggles. Accordingly, surrealist groups have always encouraged and exemplified the widest diversity&#x2014;from its start the movement was emphatically opposed to racism and colonialism, and it embraced thinkers from every race and nation.</p><p>Yet in the vast critical literature on surrealism, all but a few black poets have been invisible. Academic histories and anthologies typically, but very wrongly, persist in conveying surrealism as an all-white movement, like other "artistic schools" of European origin. In glaring contrast, the many publications of the international surrealist movement have regularly featured texts and reproductions of works by comrades from Martinique, Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, South America, the United States, and other lands.

William Dwight McKissic launches a search of his own, taking us from the days of Kunta Kinte to the very birth of humanity. His exegetical and historical perspectives shed light on important considerations for all Black believers: ï¿½Were there prominent Black characters in the Bible? Who were they? What role did they play? ï¿½Were any of the biblical writers Black? ï¿½Is there biblical evidence of a &#x201c;curse&#x201d; on dark-skinned people? ï¿½Did Black people receive Christ in slavery, or did they bring their faith with them to the shores of America? ï¿½Were there Black people on the earth before the days of Noah? ï¿½What role did Africans play in the early days of the Christian faith? "Beyond Roots: In Search of Blacks in the Bible" picks up where traditional theological training leaves off and restores to Black Christians their biblical birthright.</p><p></p><h2>Howliday Inn (Bunnicula and Friends)</h2><p>Harold and Chester could hardly believe it.

Mystery Guild Feat Alt. Tour.</p><p>Good thing Blanche White's housekeeping stint for right-wing gubernatorial hopeful Allister Brindle (a would-be politician who doesn't know anything about the Massachusetts electorate) is only temporary. Blanche, not one to suffer fools gladly, has already stuck her sharp elbow into visiting Rev. Maurice Samuelson's rib after hearing his perfidious promise to deliver the Uncle Toms and Aunt Jemimas in his flock to Brindle, and she's connived with Ray-Ray Brown, the unwelcome son of the Brindles' regular housekeeper, to keep quiet about a menacing note he's delivered to Brindle. But Blanche's position in the household is still more secure than that of Felicia Brindle's sculpted personal trainer, Saxe Winton, or of Ray-Ray himself. Both of them are murdered, with more corpses still in the offing, as Brindle and his cohorts work themselves into a frenzy over a compromising videotape unlikely to endear him to the conservative voters he's counting on. It's a case that plays beautifully to the strengths Blanche showed in her first two novels (Blanche Among the Talented Tenth, 1994, etc.): poking around, getting underfoot, and displaying maximum attitude as she solves the tiny mystery en route to sticking it to the Man. The title says it all. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Blanche White--she does not brook snide comments about her name--is definitely the working woman's heroine, and the only thing that is domesticated about her is the work she does. Queen-sized, sensible about her own dignity and that of others, Blanche can read the Boston homes she cleans like the open books they are. But when she pinch-hits for the cook of a local politico's family, she sees Mr. Brindle's wife's brittle sorrow and a son's estrangement. When the cook's son is killed, and other deaths follow in Blanche's Roxbury neighborhood, the strands connecting them lead back to the Brindles' house. Blanche does her work and methodically goes about resolving what turns out to be several murders tied to scandal, sex, and heartbreak. She does it all while raising her teenage niece and nephew as her own, trying to keep their hopes and their future safe. Blanche's voice is sassy and sexy, and her take on urban life through African American eyes is blade-sharp and sometimes as cutting. <i>GraceAnne A.

Team owners, the players felt, treated them like chattel: they "dished saltpeter in their sidemeat and gave them shameful financial <br>beatings if they misbehaved," writes Bryan <br>Di Salvatore in this fascinating, rigorous, and brisk biography.<br>A Clever Base-Ballist is also a keenly observant narrative of late nineteenth-century America.&nbsp;&nbsp;In it can be found the likes of Mark Twain, Hawaii's King Kalakuau, and Moses Fleetwood Walker, the major league's first black player.&nbsp;&nbsp;It travels from the groaning boards of Delmonico's restaurant to the boisterous pages of the 1880s entertainment press to the Egyptian desert, where the target of one thrown baseball was the Sphinx's right eye.<br>Handsome, erudite, and brilliantly talented, Ward made front-page headlines across the country when he married New York actress Helen Dauvray.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they weren't branding him a terrorist, owners trumpeted the college-educated Ward as the sport's premier role model.&nbsp;&nbsp;An unblinking antidote to "good-old-days" syndrome, A Clever Base-Ballist is an accessible, compelling, and unconventional biography of an unconventional and, until now, obscure American.</p><p>No matter how far back you go, the state of the game has always been remarkably similar to what it is today: greedy owners, economic imbalances among franchises, unequal markets, grumbling players. Using the multilayered life of 19th-century Hall-of-Famer and lawyer John Montgomery Ward as his way into the story, Bryan Di Salvatore roots around in the contemporary sources of the game's early years. For the record, Ward's career on the diamond spanned from 1878 to 1894, split between shortstop and the mound. As a pitcher, he sported an impressive 164-102 mark, won a staggering 47 games in 1879, and even hurled a perfecto; at short, he fielded his position well and hit with authority if not power. "Ward was the sort of player that other players appreciate as a teammate and curse as an opponent," Di Salvatore explains. "He beat you invisibly as often as he beat you visibly." He later managed, and like DiMaggio, he wooed and wed one of the leading actresses of the day. <p> The key to his legacy, though, can be found in the last, marvelously understated line of his Cooperstown plaque: "Played important part in establishing modern organized baseball." "For a strange, brief period," Di Salvatore writes more definitively, "John Ward was the most important man of his profession." Educated and charismatic, he was one of the first players to fully understand that a boy's game was also a man's trade, and was determined to make America realize the same. In 1885, he helped form the first players union to fight, among other inequities, the reserve clause that virtually tied players to a club forever, and a salary cap limited to whatever the poorest team in the league could afford. Four years later, he led a full-scale player revolt that formed the Players League. Though the league didn't last long, Ward, never silencing himself, continued to play and manage, eventually serving as counsel to the Brooklyn Dodgers and president of the Boston Braves. "Baseball," he once wrote, "is not a Summer snap, but a business in which capital is invested. A player is not a sporting man. He is hired to do certain work, and do it as well as he possibly can." It's a contemporary notion from out of the shadows of the past. The triumph of <i>A Clever Base-Ballist</i> is just how alive and resonant that past is. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>"This <br>is a grand book<br>--vehement, scholarly, <br>funny, exuberant, and artfully <br>evocative of the man and his time. Bryan <br>Di Salvatore is one of the finest writers <br>of nonfiction in America."<br>--Ian Frazier</p><h2>Seeing Chekhov: Life and Art</h2><p><p>"Chekhov's keen powers of observation have been remarked by both memoirists who knew him well and scholars who approach him only through the written record and across the distance of many decades. To apprehend Chekhov means seeing how Chekhov sees, and the author's remarkable vision is understood as deriving from his occupational or professional training and identity. But we have failed to register, let alone understand, just what a central concern for Chekhov himself, and how deeply problematic, were precisely issues of seeing and being seen."&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>Michael C. Finke explodes a century of critical truisms concerning Chekhov's objective eye and what being a physician gave him as a writer in a book that foregrounds the deeply subjective and self-reflexive aspects of his fiction and drama. In exploring previously unrecognized seams between the author's life and his verbal art, Finke profoundly alters and deepens our understanding of Chekhov's personality and behaviors, provides startling new interpretations of a broad array of Chekhov's texts, and fleshes out Chekhov's simultaneous pride in his identity as a physician and devastating critique of turn-of-the-century medical practices and ideologies. </p><p><i>Seeing Chekhov</i> is essential reading for students of Russian literature, devotees of the short story and modern drama, and anyone interested in the intersection of literature, psychology, and medicine.</p></p><p>"Chekhov was a master at deflecting critical attention away from his own personality, both in his writing and in his private life. But he reckoned without the supreme forensic skills of a scholar like Michael C. Finke, who seeks to probe beneath the layers of dusty clichï¿½ that have accumulated over the past century. In his incisive new book, Finke lays Chekhov bare by marshaling an impressive arsenal of analytical tools and by playing the writer at his own game, using x-ray vision to penetrate the unexpected points of contact between the life and the creative work. It is exhilarating to see Chekhov through Finke's eyes."&#x2014;Rosamund Bartlett, author of Chekhov: Scenes from a Life <p> "In Seeing Chekhov, Michael C. Finke succeeds in integrating Chekhov's life and work, his art and his science, his role as a physician and as a patient, as a dramatist and a prose writer, the personal and the professional, the pseudonyms that efface his identity and those that all but proclaim it. Chekhov's preference for not being seen, as it turns out, demands that we examine his strategies of hiding rather than obligingly averting our eyes. The payoff in terms of insight into Chekhov's poetics is enormous."&#x2014;Cathy Popkin, Lionel Trilling Professor in the Humanities, Columbia University</p><p>Michael C. Finke is Associate Professor of Russian in the International and Area Studies Program at Washington University in St. Louis.

My name is Tom Wallace; I work in Publications at the North American Aircraft plant in Inglewood, California. We were living in Hawthorne, renting a two-bedroom tract house owned by one of our next-door neighbors, Mildred Sentas. Another neighbor, Frank Wanamaker, and I usually drove to and from the plant together, alternating cars. But Frank didn&#x2019;t like Saturday work and had managed to beg off that particular day. So I drove home alone.<br>As I turned onto Tulley Street, I saw the &#x2019;51 Mercury coupe parked in front of our house and knew that Anne&#x2019;s brother, Philip, was visiting. He was a psychology major at the University of California in Berkeley and he sometimes drove down to L.A. for weekends. This was the first time he&#x2019;d been to our new place; we&#x2019;d only moved in two months before.<br>I nosed the Ford into the driveway and braked it in front of the garage. Across the street Frank Wanamaker&#x2019;s wife, Elizabeth, was sitting on their lawn pulling up weeds. She smiled faintly at me and raised one white-gloved hand. I waved to her as I got out of the car and started for the porch. As I went up its two steps I saw Elizabeth struggle to her feet and adjust her maternity smock. The baby was due in about three months. It was the Wanamaker&#x2019;s first in seven years of marriage.<br>When I opened the front door and went into the living room, I saw Phil sitting at the kitchen table, a bottle of Coca-Cola in front of him. He was about twenty, tall and lean, his darkish-brown hair crew-cut. He glanced in at me and grinned.<br>&#x201c;Hi, brother man,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d; I took off my suit coat and hung it in the front closet. Anne met me in the kitchen doorway with a smile and a kiss.<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the little mother?&#x201d; I asked, patting her stomach.<br>&#x201c;Gross,&#x201d; she said.<br>I chuckled and kissed her again.<br>&#x201c;As they say,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;hot enough for you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even talk about it,&#x201d; she answered.<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hungry?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Ravenous.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good. Phil and I were just about to start.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Be right with you.&#x201d; I washed my hands and sat down across from Phil, eyeing his blindingly green polo shirt.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that for,&#x201d; I asked, &#x201c;warning off aircraft?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Glows in the dark,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Helps the co-eds keep track of you at night,&#x201d; I said. Phil grinned.<br>&#x201c;Now don&#x2019;t you two get started again,&#x201d; Anne said, putting a dish of cold cuts on the table.<br>&#x201c;Whatever does you mean?&#x201d; Phil said to her.<br>&#x201c;Never mind now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want any needling session this weekend. It&#x2019;s too hot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Agreed,&#x201d; said Phil, &#x201c;needling excluded. Agreed, brother man?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And spoil my weekend?&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; said Anne. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t face that and the heat both.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Richard?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Playing in the backyard with Candy.&#x201d; Anne sat down beside me with a groan. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a load off my feet,&#x201d; she said.<br>I patted her hand and we started eating.<br>&#x201c;Speaking of Candy,&#x201d; Anne said, &#x201c;I trust you haven&#x2019;t forgotten the party tonight at Elsie&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I did forget. Do we have to go?&#x201d;<br>Anne shrugged. &#x201c;She invited us a week ago. That was excuse time. It&#x2019;s too late now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Confusion.&#x201d; I bit into my ham on rye.<br>&#x201c;Brother man seems less than joyous,&#x201d; Phil said. &#x201c;Elsie&#x2019;s shindigs no goo&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No goo&#x2019;,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Who is she?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Our next-door neighbor,&#x201d; Anne told him. &#x201c;Candy&#x2019;s her little girl.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And parties are her profession,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the poor man&#x2019;s Elsa Maxwell.&#x201d;<br>Anne smiled and shook her head. &#x201c;Poor Elsie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If she only knew what awful things we say behind her back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dull, huh?&#x201d; said Phil.<br>&#x201c;Why talk?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Go to the party with us and see for yourself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll liven &#x2019;er up,&#x201d; said Phil.<br>* * *<br>A little after eight-fifteen Richard fell asleep in his crib and we went next door to Elsie&#x2019;s house. In most marriages you think of a couple&#x2019;s home as <i>theirs</i>. Not so with that house. Ron may have made the payments on it but the ownership was strictly Elsie&#x2019;s. You felt it.<br>It was Ron who answered our knock. He was twenty-four, a couple of years older than Elsie, a couple of inches taller. He was slightly built, sandy-haired with a round, boyish face that seldom lost its impassive set; even when he smiled as he did then, the ends of his mouth curling up slightly.<br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; he said in his quiet, polite voice.<br>Frank and Elizabeth were already there, Elizabeth settled on the red sofa like a diffident patient in a dentist&#x2019;s waiting room, Frank&#x2019;s thin body slouched in one of the red arm chairs. He brightened only a little when we came in, raising his bored gaze from the green rug, straightening up in the chair, then standing. I introduced Phil around.<br>&#x201c;Hi!&#x201d;<br>I glanced over and saw Elsie peering around the corner of the kitchen doorway. She&#x2019;d cut her dark hair still shorter and bobbed it still tighter, I noticed. When we&#x2019;d moved into the neighborhood, she&#x2019;d had long, drabby blond hair.<br>We all said hello to her and she disappeared a moment, then came into the room with a tray of drinks in her hands. She was wearing a red, netlike dress which clung tightly to the curves of her plump body. When she bent over to put the tray down on the blondwood coffee table, the bosom of the dress slipped away from her tight, black brassiere. I noticed Frank&#x2019;s pointed stare, then Elsie straightened up with a brassy, hostesslike smile and looked at Phil. Anne introduced them.<br>&#x201c;Hel-<i>lo</i>,&#x201d; Elsie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you could come.&#x201d; She looked at us. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;name your poison.&#x201d;<br>What happened that evening up to the point when it all began is not important. There were the usual peregrinations to the kitchen and the bathroom; the usual breaking up and re-gathering of small groups&#x2014;the women, the men, Frank, Phil and myself, Elizabeth and Anne, Elsie and Phil, Ron and me&#x2014;and so on; the drifting knots of conversation that take place at any get-together.<br>There was record music and a little sporadic attempt at dancing. There was Candy stumbling into the living room, blinking and numb with only half-broken sleep; being tucked back into her bed. There were the expected personality displays&#x2014;Frank, cynical and bored; Elizabeth, quietly radiant in her pregnancy; Phil, amusing and quick; Ron, mute and affable; Anne, soft-spoken and casual; Elsie, bouncing and strainedly vivacious.<br>One bit of conversation I remember: I was just about to go next door to check on Richard when Elsie said something about our getting a baby-sitter.<br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter when you just go next door like this,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but you do have to get out once in a while.&#x201d; Once in a while, to Elsie, meant an average of four nights a week.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like to,&#x201d; Anne said, &#x201c;but we just haven&#x2019;t been able to find one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Try ours,&#x201d; said Elsie. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a nice kid and real reliable.&#x201d;<br>That was when I left and checked on Richard&#x2014;and had one of my many nighttime adorations; that standing in semi-darkness over your child&#x2019;s crib and staring down at him. Nothing else. Just standing there and staring down at his little sleep-flushed face and feeling that almost overwhelming rush of absolute love in yourself. Sensing something close to holy in the same little being that nearly drove you out of your mind that very afternoon.<br>I turned up the heat a little then and went back to Elsie&#x2019;s house.<br>They were talking about hypnotism. I say <i>they</i> but, outside of Phil, Anne and maybe Frank, no one there knew the least thing about it. Primarily, it was a dissertation by Phil on one of his favorite topics.<br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t believe that,&#x201d; Elsie said as I sat down beside Anne and whispered that Richard was fine. &#x201c;People who say they were hypnotized weren&#x2019;t, really.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course they were,&#x201d; Phil said. &#x201c;If they weren&#x2019;t, how could they have hatpins jabbed into their throats without bleeding? Without even crying out?&#x201d;<br>Elsie turned her head halfway to the side and looked at Phil in that overdone, accusingly dubious way that people affect when they have to bolster their own uncertain doubts.<br>&#x201c;Did you ever <i>really</i> see anyone get a hatpin jabbed in their throat?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had a five-inch hatpin in my throat,&#x201d; Phil answered. &#x201c;And, once, I put one halfway through a friend of mine&#x2019;s arm at school&#x2014;after I&#x2019;d hypnotized him.&#x201d;<br>Elsie shuddered histrionically. &#x201c;<i>Uhh</i>,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;how <i>awful</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Phil said with that casual tone undergraduates love to affect when they are flicking off intellectual bombshells. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t feel a thing and neither did my friend.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re just making that up,&#x201d; Elsie said, studiedly disbelieving.<br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Phil.<br>It was Frank who gave it the final, toppling push.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s see you hypnotize somebody then.&#x201d; He squeezed out one of his faintly cruel smiles. &#x201c;Hypnotize Elsie,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Oh, no you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Elsie squealed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to do terrible things in front of everybody.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t believe in it,&#x201d; Phil said, amusedly.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;But...well, not <i>me</i>.&#x201d;<br>Frank&#x2019;s dark eyes moved. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;who&#x2019;s going to be hypnotized?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t suggest me unless we want to spend the whole night here,&#x201d; Anne said. &#x201c;Phil used to waste hours trying to hypnotize me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lousy subject, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; Phil said, grinning at her.<br>&#x201c;Okay, who&#x2019;s it gonna be then?&#x201d; Frank persisted. &#x201c;How about you, Lizzie?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh... &#x201d; Elizabeth lowered her eyes and smiled embarrassedly.<br>&#x201c;We promise not to make you take your clothes off,&#x201d; Frank said.<br>&#x201c;<i>Frank</i>.&#x201d; Elizabeth was thirty-one but she still blushed like a little girl. She wouldn&#x2019;t look at anybody. Elsie giggled. Frank looked only vaguely pleased. Elizabeth was too easy a mark for him.<br>&#x201c;Come on, Elsie,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;be a sport. Let him put you under. We won&#x2019;t make you do a strip tease on the kitchen table.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d; Ron started to say.<br>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re awful!&#x201d; Elsie said, delighted.<br>&#x201c;What were you going to say, Ron?&#x201d; I asked.<br>Ron swallowed. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I was going to ask Phil,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you&#x2014;can&#x2019;t make someone&#x2014;do what they don&#x2019;t want to do, can you? I mean&#x2014;what they <i>wouldn&#x2019;t</i> do? If they were awake, I mean.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, what do <i>you</i> know about hypnotism, Ronny?&#x201d; Elsie asked, trying to sound pleasantly amused. The acidity still came through.<br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s true and it isn&#x2019;t true,&#x201d; Phil said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t make a subject break his own moral code. <i>But</i>&#x2014;you can make almost any act fit into his moral code.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How do you mean?&#x201d; Frank asked. &#x201c;This sounds promising.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, for instance,&#x201d; Phil said, &#x201c;if I hypnotized your wife&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You could make her do something <i>wicked</i>!&#x201d; Frank asked, looking at Elizabeth pointedly.<br>&#x201c;Frank, please,&#x201d; she almost whispered.<br>&#x201c;Say I put a loaded gun in her hand,&#x201d; Phil said, &#x201c;and told her to shoot you. She wouldn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you think,&#x201d; Frank said, snickering. I looked at Elizabeth again and saw her swallowing dryly. She was one of those pale and pitiable creatures who seem constantly vulnerable to hurt. You want to protect them and yet you can&#x2019;t. Of course Frank wasn&#x2019;t the easiest man in the world to live with either.<br>&#x201c;Well, for argument&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Phil said, smiling a little, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll assume she wouldn&#x2019;t shoot you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, for argument&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Frank said. He glanced at Elizabeth, a hint of that cruel smile on his lips again.<br>&#x201c;<i>But</i>,&#x201d; Phil said, &#x201c;if I were to tell Elizabeth that you were going to strangle her and told her that the only defense in the world she had was to shoot you right away&#x2014;well, she might very well shoot you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How true,&#x201d; said Frank.<br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t believe that,&#x201d; said Elsie.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I joined in. &#x201c;We have a friend named Alan Porter&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a psychiatrist&#x2014;and he gave a demonstration of that very thing. He had a young mother under hypnosis and he told her he was going to kill her baby and the only way she could stop him was by stabbing him with the knife she was holding&#x2014;it was a piece of cardboard. She stabbed him all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s different,&#x201d; said Elsie. &#x201c;Anyway, she was probably just playing along with a gag.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; said Phil, gesturing dramatically with his hands, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll prove it to you right now if you want. Just let me hypnotize you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, <i>sir</i>,&#x201d; said Elsie, &#x201c;not me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How about you?&#x201d; Phil asked Ron.<br>Ron mumbled something and shook his head with a faint smile. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s already half hypnotized,&#x201d; said Elsie, kindly.<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I get me a customer?&#x201d; asked Phil. He sounded disappointed.<br>&#x201c;How about you, Frank?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Uh-uh,&#x201d; he said, smiling as he blew out cigarette smoke. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want ol&#x2019; Lizzie knowing what&#x2019;s in my dirty old subconscious.&#x201d;<br>Elsie giggled and Elizabeth pressed her lips together, having failed in the attempt to smile.<br>&#x201c;Well, that leaves you, brother man,&#x201d; said Phil, looking at me.<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really think you could hypnotize <i>me</i>, do you?&#x201d; I needled.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so darn sure,&#x201d; he said, wagging a finger at me. &#x201c;You arrogant ones are the first to topple.&#x201d;<br>I grinned, shrugging. &#x201c;So what have I got to lose?&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright ï¿½ 1958, renewed 1986 by RXR, Inc</p><h2>Where Do Camels Belong?: The story and science of invasive species</h2><p>Where Do Camels Belong<br>Where do camels belong? In the Arab world may seem the obvious answer, but they are relative newcomers there. They evolved in North America, retain their greatest diversity in South America, and the only remaining wild dromedaries are in Australia. This is a classic example of the contradictions of 'native' and 'invasive' species, a hot issue right now, as the flip-side of biodiversity. We have all heard the horror stories of invasives, from Japanese knotweed that puts fear into the heart of gardeners to brown tree snakes that have taken over the island of Guam. But do we need to fear invaders? And indeed, can we control them, and do we choose the right targets? Ken Thompson puts forward a fascinating array of narratives to explore what he sees as the crucial question - why only a minority of introduced species succeed, and why so few of them go on to cause trouble. He discusses, too, whether our fears could be getting in the way of conserving biodiversity, and responding to the threat of climate change.<br></p><p>Dr Ken Thompson was for twenty years a lecturer in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield. He writes regularly on gardening for the Daily Telegraph. His previous book was Do We Need Pandas? The uncomfortable truth about biodiversity.Thompson makes his case in a lively, readable style, spiced with a healthy dose of sarcasm towards &#34;aliens = bad&#34; fundamentalists. Better yet, he bolsters his argument with plenty of citations from the scientific literature, which adds welcome heft. -- Bob Holmes New Scientist Lively and punchy...You walk away from this book feeling flushed and a bit bruised. -- James McConnachie Sunday Times Ken Thompson...challenges us to look at the issue dispassionately and logically...a well put together book about the science and the philosophy surrounding invasive species. -- Simon Barnes Times An important and thought provoking book that deserves widespread exposure. At risk of hyperbole, I&#39;d say it is to ecology what Darwin&#39;s Origin of Species was to evolution. -- Brian Clegg popularscience.co.uk</p><h2>The Glory of Christ: His Office and Grace (John Owen Series)</h2><p><p></p><p> To see the glory of Christ is one of the greatest privileges that a Christian can enjoy. Anyone who does not see his glory in this world, will not see his glory in heaven, and no one should look for anything in heaven that he has not experienced in this life.

From boxing a kangaroo in Australia to craving Mexican food in Taiwan, or riding a runaway camel in Egypt and eating cheese as holey and smelly as their socks in Switzerland, the globe is their imaginary playground.<br> Gary Soto's accessible and humorous poems will elicit nods of recognition and bursts of laughter as readers enjoy this outrageous jaunt around the world.<br> Praise for <i>Fearless Fernie: Hanging Out With Fernie and Me</i><br><br></p><p>Grade 4-7&#x2013;Fernie and his best friend [from <i>Fearless Fernie: Hanging Out with Fernie and Me</i> (Putnam, 2002)] are off on an imaginary trip around the world. The conversational style of the free verse exhibits the same humor and insight that will engage readers, though the premise of this collection doesn't work quite as well as its predecessor. The opening poem, "Itching to Travel," sets the boys on their journey: "We itched to go places,/To double-tie our shoes and roll away on skateboards./And why? We knew only our back and front yards,/School and the playground...So one morning/Fergie and me jumped off the roof of the doghouse/And started up the street, our shadows struggling to keep up." They imagine themselves from San Francisco to Hawaii, hitting countries on every continent until they wind up back home. Their experiences are as silly and stereotypical as one would expect from these characters, oddly defeating the purpose of the travelogue&#x2013;from tattoos in the Philippines to safari in Kenya, from a camel encounter in Aswan to kilts in Scotland. It's funny, but not, in the end, very interesting, and strays from the wonderful realism that connected readers in the first title. Oh well&#x2013;kids who enjoyed the first one will appreciate being reunited with the characters.<i>&#x2013;Nina Lindsay, Oakland Public Library, CA</i>Gr. 4-6. The two middle-school best friends who appeared in <i>Fearless Fernie</i> (2001) are together again, but this time they leave behind their backyards and their school and take off to tour the world. Whether the boys are on safari in Kenya, on the beach in Hawaii, sharing a salami sausage snack in Sicily, or craving Mexican food in Taiwan, the simple, mischievous poems and black-and-white cartoonlike art show that the imaginary global adventures are never really far from home. It's the friendship story, both silly and affectionate, that is the real subject. The most moving poem, "The Road Not Taken . . . in Peru," a takeoff on Robert Frost's classic, finds the friends choosing separate paths, then retracing steps ("He went down mine, me his") to find themselves wiser for traveling both roads. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Mrs. &#x201c;Kinky&#x201d; Kincaid, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s housekeeper, had breakfast on, and Barry realized he was ravenous.<br>Feet thumped down the stairs, and a deep voice said, &#x201c;Morning, Kinky.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Morning yourself, Doctor dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Young Laverty up yet?&#x201d; Despite the fact that half the village of Ballybucklebo, County Down, Northern Ireland, had been partying in his back garden for much of the night, Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly, Laverty&#x2019;s senior colleague, was up and doing.<br>&#x201c;I heard him moving about, so.&#x201d;<br>Barry&#x2019;s head was a little woozy, but he smiled as he left his small attic bedroom. He found the Cork woman&#x2019;s habit of tacking &#x201c;so&#x201d; to the ends of most of her sentences endearing and less grating than the &#x201c;so it is&#x201d; or &#x201c;so I will&#x201d; added for emphasis by the folks from his native province of Ulster.<br>In the bathroom he washed the sleep from his blue eyes, which in the shaving mirror blinked at him from an oval face under fair hair, a cowlick sticking up from the crown.<br>He finished dressing and went downstairs to the dining room, passing as he did the ground-floor parlour that Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly used as his surgery, which Barry knew an American doctor would have called his &#x201c;office.&#x201d; He hoped to be spending a lot of time here in the future. He paused to glimpse inside the by now familiar room.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stand there with both legs the same length,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly growled from the dining room opposite. &#x201c;Come on in and let Kinky feed us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Coming.&#x201d; Barry went into the dining room, blinking at the August sunlight streaming in through the bay windows.<br>&#x201c;Morning, Barry.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly, wearing a collarless striped shirt and red braces to hold up his tweed trousers, sat at the head of a large mahogany table, a teacup held in one big hand.<br>&#x201c;Morning, Fingal.&#x201d; Barry sat and poured himself a cup. &#x201c;Grand day.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I could agree,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly, &#x201c;if I didn&#x2019;t have a bit of a strong weakness.&#x201d; He yawned and massaged one temple, his bushy eyebrows moving closer as he spoke. Barry could see tiny veins in the whites of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s brown eyes. The big man&#x2019;s craggy face with its cauliflower ears and listing-to-port nose broke into a grin. &#x201c;When I was in the navy it&#x2019;s what we used to call &#x2018;a self-inflicted injury.&#x2019; It was quite the ta-ta-ta-ra yesterday.&#x201d;<br>Barry laughed and wondered how many pints of Guinness his mentor had sunk the previous night. Ordinarily drink would have as much effect on O&#x2019;Reilly as a teaspoon of water on a forest fire. Barry still wasn&#x2019;t sure if the man&#x2019;s magnanimous offer, made in the middle of what had seemed to be the hooley to end all hooleys, had been the Guinness talking or whether O&#x2019;Reilly was serious. When he&#x2019;d first woken he&#x2019;d thought he might&#x2019;ve dreamed the whole thing, but now he clearly remembered that he&#x2019;d vowed before laying his head on the pillow to muster the courage this morning to ask O&#x2019;Reilly if he had meant it.<br>He knew he could let the hare sit, wait for O&#x2019;Reilly to repeat the offer under more professional circumstances, but damn it all, this was important. Barry glanced down at the table, then back straight into O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Fingal,&#x201d; he said putting down his cup.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You were serious, weren&#x2019;t you, about offering me a full-time assistantship for one year and then a partnership in your practice?&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s cup stopped halfway to his lips. His hairline moved lower and rumpled the skin of his forehead. Pallor appeared at the tip of his bent nose.<br>Barry involuntarily turned one shoulder towards the big man, as a pistol duellist of old might have done in order to present his enemy with a smaller target. The pale nose was a sure sign that fires smouldering beneath O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s crust were about to break through the surface.<br>&#x201c;Was I what?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly slammed his cup into his saucer. &#x201c;Was I what?&#x201d;<br>Barry swallowed. &#x201c;I only meant&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Holy thundering mother of Jesus Christ Almighty I know what you meant. Why the hell would you think I wasn&#x2019;t serious?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well...&#x201d; Barry struggled desperately to find diplomatic words. &#x201c;You... that is, we... we&#x2019;d had a fair bit to drink.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly pushed his chair away from the table, cocked his head to one side, stared at Barry&#x2014;and began to laugh, great throaty rumbles.<br>Barry looked expectantly into O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s face. His nose tip had returned to its usually florid state. The laugh lines at the corners of the big man&#x2019;s eyes had deepened.<br>&#x201c;Yes, Doctor Barry Laverty, I was serious. Of course I was bloody well serious. I&#x2019;d like you to stay.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t thank me. Thank yourself. I&#x2019;d not have made you the offer if I didn&#x2019;t think you were fitting in here in Ballybucklebo, and if the customers hadn&#x2019;t taken a shine to you.&#x201d;<br>Barry smiled.<br>&#x201c;You just keep it up. You hear me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly stood and started to walk round the table until he stood over Barry. O&#x2019;Reilly stretched out his right hand. &#x201c;If we were a couple of horse traders we&#x2019;d spit on our hands before we sealed the contract, but I think maybe a couple of GPs should forgo that in favour of a simple handshake.&#x201d;<br>Barry rose and accepted O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s clasp, relieved to find it wasn&#x2019;t the man&#x2019;s usual knuckle-crushing version of a handshake. &#x201c;Thanks, Fingal,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks a lot and I will try to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you will,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly, releasing Barry&#x2019;s hand, &#x201c;but all this serious conversation has me famished, and I&#x2019;m like a bull with a headache until I get my breakfast. Where the hell&#x2019;s Kinky?&#x201d; He turned and started to amble back to his chair.<br>Barry heard a loud rumbling from O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s stomach. He did not say, &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Barry had learned that the man never apologized; indeed his confession of being short-tempered in the morning was the closest Barry knew O&#x2019;Reilly would get to expressing regret for having roared at Barry moments earlier. The man rarely explained himself and seemed to live entirely by his own set of rules, the first being &#x201c;Never, never, never let the patients get the upper hand.&#x201d;<br>Barry heard a noise behind him and turned to see Mrs. Kincaid standing in the doorway. He hadn&#x2019;t heard her coming. For a woman of her size she was light on her feet.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re ready now for your breakfast, are you, Doctors?&#x201d; she said, moving into the room, setting a tray on the sideboard, lifting plates, and putting one before O&#x2019;Reilly and one in front of Barry. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to interrupt. I know you&#x2019;re discussing important things, so.&#x201d; Her eyes twinkled and she winked at Barry. &#x201c;But you get carried away sometimes, don&#x2019;t you, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly dear? I hear that kind of thing is very bad for the blood pressure.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Get away with you, Kinky.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly was grinning at her, but with the kind of look a small boy might give his mother when he knew he&#x2019;d been caught out in some peccadillo.<br>Barry turned his attention to his breakfast. On his plate two rashers of Belfast bacon kept an orange-yolked egg company. Half a fried tomato perched on a crisp triangle of soda farl. A pork sausage, two rings of black pudding, and one of white topped off the repast. He felt himself salivate as the steam rising from the platter tickled his nostrils. If professional reasons weren&#x2019;t enough to keep him here, Mrs. Kincaid&#x2019;s cooking certainly tipped the scales. &#x201c;Thanks, Kinky,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When I get through this, I&#x2019;ll be ready to go and call the cows home.&#x201d;<br>He saw her smile. &#x201c;Eat up however little much is in it, and leave the cows to the farmers, so.&#x201d; She turned to go, her silver chignon catching the sun&#x2019;s rays as they slipped through the room&#x2019;s bay window to sparkle in her hair and plant diamonds in the cut-glass decanters on the sideboard.<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Kinky,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly, tucking a linen napkin into his shirt-neck. He waved his fork. &#x201c;Begod I could eat a horse, a bloody Clydesdale, saddle and all.&#x201d; He shoved most of one rasher into his mouth.<br>Barry swallowed a small piece of tomato.<br>O&#x2019;Reilly speared a piece of black pudding and chewed with what appeared to be the enthusiasm of a famished crocodile feeding on a fat springbok. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t face the day without my breakfast. Once I get this into me, I&#x2019;ll be a new man.&#x201d;<br>As Barry sliced his bacon he heard the front doorbell, Kinky&#x2019;s footsteps, and a man&#x2019;s voice. Kinky reappeared in the dining room. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Archibald Auchinleck, the milkman.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On a Sunday morning?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly growled through a mouthful of soda farl.<br>&#x201c;He says he&#x2019;s sorry, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly growled, ripping the napkin from his throat. &#x201c;Between you making breakfast late with your questions and the patients interrupting it,&#x201d; he said, eyeing Barry, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll die of starvation.&#x201d; He stood and walked down past the table. Mrs. Kincaid moved up the other side. The pair of them look like partners in a slip jig, Barry thought.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pop this back in the oven. Keep it warm, so.&#x201d; She lifted...</p></p><h2>The New Hacker&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p>From ack to zorch - and with hundreds of other entries in between - \&#34;The New Hacker&#39;s Dictionary\&#34; is a comprehensive compendium of the remarkable slang used by today&#39;s computer hackers. Although it is organized in reference form, it is not a mere technical dictionary or a dry handbook of terms; rather, it offers the reader an armchair tour of hackerdom&#39;s myths, heroes, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams - a riotous and thought-provoking unveiling of the continent-spanning electronic communities that knit hackers together. This book is a joy to read.</p><p>This third edition of the tremendously popular Hacker&#39;s Dictionary adds 100 new entries and updates 200 entries. In case you aren&#39;t familiar with it, this is no snoozer dictionary of technical terms, although you&#39;ll certainly find accurate definitions for most techie jargon. It&#39;s the slang and secret language among computer jocks that offers the most fun. Don&#39;t know what the Infinite-Monkey Theorem is? Or the meaning of &#34;rat dance?&#34; It&#39;s all here. Most people don&#39;t sit down to read dictionaries for entertainment, but this is surely an exception.This third edition of &#39;The New Hackers Dictionary&#39; mainly deepens rather than broadens the lexicon; there are about a hundred new entries, but many more changes adding new meanings, background, and etymological history. In the age of the &#39;information superhighway&#39; this book is more relevant, and more needed, than ever before.</p><h2>The Ladybird Book of the Hipster (Ladybirds for Grown-Ups)</h2><p>The PERFECT STOCKING FILLER for the terminally cool. _________________________________________________ This is a hipster.

This is not always an advantage: fairly trite poems, put into ritualistic rhythms, at first seem more impressive than on second reading, while personal poems become weakened as emotion and experience gives way to an imposed ritual form. When ritual merges with contemporary American political consciousness, as in "Nuke Devils: the Indian women listen," Rose transforms anger into pride: "and nothing you can do/ will stop us/ as we re-make/ your weapons into charms." The book's final section represents an interesting new direction for Rose's work, as she evokes personified voicestortured social outcastswhom she finds representative of her own state.

"Cirrus," "cumulus," and "stratus" now seem almost self-evident descriptions, but when Howard gave his epochal lecture at London's Askesian Society in 1802, the bewildering variety of clouds was more obvious than anything else. Howard's great achievement, writes Hamblyn with characteristic elegance, was "the penetrating insight that clouds have many individual shapes but few basic forms." His graceful rï¿½sumï¿½ of meteorology from the time of the ancient Chinese shows just how difficult generations of scientists found it to make sense of clouds, which frequently served as a metaphor for the awesome complexity of the natural world. Hamblyn's marvelous portrait of English cultural life at the turn of the 19th century reminds us how enthralled the general public was by scientific lectures and demonstrations, which served as a form of popular entertainment as well as a valuable tool in the dissemination of knowledge. "People cheered at lectures," he notes, and young men like Howard, a pharmacist by trade, "refused to allow the circumstances in which they found themselves to deflect them from [a] heroic sense of destiny." This was the great age of amateur scientists, many of them Dissenters like Howard whose religious unorthodoxy barred them from government service and aristocratic clubs. They forged their own place in England's burgeoning industries and in the scientific revolution unleashed by Isaac Newton. Howard, a devoted husband and father active in educational work and the antislavery movement, was representative of the remarkable autodidacts who reshaped European culture. Their work "served the equal demands of pleasure, instruction, and imagination," states Hamblyn, whose delightful book fulfills the same admirable purpose. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Richard Hamblyn</b> was born in 1965 and is a graduate of the universities of Essex and Cambridge, where he wrote a doctoral dissertation on the early history of geology in Britain.

It&#x2019;s unclear who exactly is in charge and what role they play. The same influential people seem to reappear time after time in different professional guises, pressing their own agendas in one venue after another. According to award-winning public policy scholar and anthropologist Janine Wedel, these are the powerful &#x201c;shadow elite,&#x201d; the main players in a vexing new system of power and influence.<br><br> In this groundbreaking book, Wedel charts how this shadow elite, loyal only to their own, challenge both governments&#x2019; rules of accountability and business codes of competition to accomplish their own goals. From the Harvard economists who helped privatize post-Soviet Russia and the neoconservatives who have helped privatize American foreign policy (culminating with the debacle that is Iraq) to the many private players who daily make public decisions without public input, these manipulators both grace the front pages and operate behind the scenes. Wherever they maneuver, they flout once-sacrosanct boundaries between state and private.<br><br> Profoundly original, <i>Shadow Elite</i> gives us the tools we need to recognize these powerful yet elusive players and comprehend the new system.

From irresponsible drifter, to dreamer of impossible dreams, to drunkard, to frequent patient at an insane asylum, Exley carried baggage from his childhood through much of his adult life, never feeling he could escape the dark cloud of expectation that hung over him.

Prophetess Jane Hawkins, called "a witty crafty baggage" by one angry bishop, got around the ironclad law forbidding women to preach by claiming inspiration from God, while Catholic Mary Ward risked her neck repeatedly to found a string of convents and schools for girls on the European continent. Although several good wives of London beat the Lord Mayor in 1649 for his part in trying to arrest five members of Parliament, it's certainly true that most Englishwomen of the time were hemmed in by the whims and fears of men. Wealthy girls were routinely used as chips to bolster family fortunes through marriage, and any old, poor woman unfortunate enough to have "a furred brow, a hairy lip, a squint eye, a squeaking voice or a scolding tongue" lived under suspicion of witchcraft, wrote one contemporary observer. In Fraser's sure hands and supple prose, memorable and execrable historic moments spring to life. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i>&#34;An almost encyclopedic chronicle of women in 17th century England...wives, warriors, heiresses, preachers... alive with anecdote after anecdote.&#34; - New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Young&#39;s Literal Translation of the Bible</h2><p>Robert Young&#39;s 1898 edition of his translation. This is the third and last edition that he produced. Translation uses the same Elizabethian language that the King James Version uses. However, being a strictly literal translation, the word order is different from the KJV, so it does read different than the KJV and can be difficult at times to read. Being a strictly literal translation makes it the perfect study tool. You can now see exactly what God said and how He said it. There is no changing of words, no softening of words or passages, just translated strictly as it was written in the original languages. Text is done in 9 point print, which is larger and easier to read than the print sizes used in the past by other publishers. This translation will allow the reader to see exactly what God said and will allow a more precise study of the Bible. How can a reader study a Bible when the translators have have interpreted instead of translated? The vast number of modern translation interpret (tell you what they thought God meant) instead of translate (tell you what God actually said). When Robert Young translated this edition, he was not trying to please or appease someone, he was not trying to be politically correct, he was not translating in an attempt to rewrite the Bible to fit his theological beliefs. With this Bible, you get the word of God and nothing but the word of God.</p><p>Thanks to all for the valuable feedback you have given on this volume of the "Holy Bible Young's Literal Translation." We hear you!<br>Some feedback refers to the small size of the print and how everything crowds together. I actually agree with this... and wish we could do better. I tried some larger and different fonts... to no avail. I am actually considering removing it from our available titles. We do not want to hurt anyone, and I think you can actually get a better version from other vendors.<br>I am going to make a few changes, and review the feedback again in a month or two. I will then make a decision on whether to continue the publication. Thanks again for the reviews... and may the Lord bless you as you study and learn from our Lord's Word!<br>C.

Interwoven through these different narrative strands comes the story of the whiskies themselves, traced from a distant past of bothies and illegal stills to present-day legality and prosperity. The flavour of each spirit is analysed and the differences between them teased out, as are the stories of the notable men and women who have played such a integral part in their creation.</p><p>PEAT SMOKE AND SPIRIT is the last word on Islay and its whiskies.</p></p><p>Andrew Jefford was the drink correspondent of the Evening Standard, and is a regular broadcaster on the BBC and the author of many acclaimed books.

Kipper won a BAFTA for Best Animated Film.PreSchool-Grade 2AA new baby is on the way and the family is moving to a bigger house. In the attic, the movers uncover an old stuffed toy. The little abandoned creature, newly conscious after having been squashed and forgotten for years, hears the men say, on catching sight of him, "Oh, it's nothing" and concludes that Nothing must be his name. As he wanders about trying to figure out where he belongs, Nothing meets various animals, and memories of his past begin to return in snatches. Eventually, a cat befriends him and carries him to the new house. Grandpa recognizes the toy as one of his childhood favorites and all ends happily. This is a charming tale in the tradition of The Velveteen Rabbit. The watercolor illustrations are full of interesting perspectives. A foldout page that depicts Nothing's transformation ("with the help of a good wash, some scraps of material...and some thread") back into a little cloth tabby cat is particularly endearing. The spirited prose moves along at a lively pace. However, the ending is quite complicated and may prove confusing to the young children for whom this book is intended. Because of the complex denouement, this fetching picture book is more suitable for one-to-one than group sharing.ASue Norris, Rye Free Reading Room, NY<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christmas in My Heart 5</h2><p>If you love old-timey stories, then this book is for you and your loved ones.

Confined to a wheelchair, retired historian Lyman Ward sets out to write his grandparents' remarkable story, chronicling their days spent carving civilization into the surface of America's western frontier. But his research reveals even more about his own life than he's willing to admit. What emerges is an enthralling portrait of four generations in the life of an American family.</p><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize when it was first published in 1971, Angle of Repose has also been selected by the editorial board of the Modern Library as one of the hundred best novels of the twentieth century.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Wallace Stegner's uniquely American classic centers on Lyman Ward, a noted historian who relates a fictionalized biography of his pioneer grandparents at a time when he has become estranged from his own family. Through a combination of research, memory, and exaggeration, Ward voices ideas concerning the relationship between history and the present, art and life, parents and children, husbands and wives. Set in many parts of the West, Angle of Repose is a story of discovery--personal, historical, and geographical--that endures as Wallace Stegner's masterwork: an illumination of yesterday's reality that speaks to today's.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angle of Repose is a long, intricate, deeply rewarding novel," wrote William Abrahams in the Atlantic Monthly. "[It] is neither the predictable historical-regional Western epic, nor the equally predictable four-decker family saga, the Forsytes in California, so to speak. . . . For all [its] breadth and sweep, Angle of Repose achieves an effect of intimacy, hence of immediacy, and, though much of the material is 'historical,' an effect of discovery also, of experience newly minted rather than a pageantlike re-creation. . . . Wallace Stegner has written a superb novel, with an amplitude of scale and richness of detail altogether uncommon in contemporary fiction."<br>"Angle of Repose is a novel about Time, as much as anything--about people who live through time, who believe in both a past and a future. . . . It reveals how even the most rebellious crusades of our time follow paths that our great-grandfathers' feet beat dusty."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Wallace Stegner<b>Wallace Stegner</b> was born in 1909 in Lake Mills, Iowa. The son of Scandinavian immigrants, he traveled with his parents and brother all over the West-to North Dakota, Washington, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming-before settling in Salt Lake City in 1921. Many of the landscapes he encountered in his peripatetic youth figure largely in his work, as do characters based on his stern father and athletic, outgoing brother. Stegner received most of his education in Utah, graduating from the University in 1930. He furthered his education at the University of Iowa, where he received a master's and a doctoral degree. He married Mary Stuart Page in 1934, and for the next decade the couple followed Wallace's teaching career-to the University of Wisconsin, Harvard, and eventually to Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program, and where he was to remain until his retirement in 1971. A number of his creative writing students have become some of today's most well respected writers, including Wendell Berry, Thomas McGuane, Raymond Carver, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Larry McMurty.<br><br>Throughout his career and after, Stegner's literary output was tremendous. His first novel, Remembering Laughter, was published in 1937. By the time of his death in 1993 he had published some two dozen works of fiction, history, biography, and essays. Among his many literary prizes are the Pulitzer Prize for <b>Angle of Repose</b> (1971) and the National Book Award for <b>The Spectator Bird </b>(1976). His collection of essays, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b> (1992), was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle award.<p><br>Although his fiction deals with many universal themes, Stegner is primarily recognized as a writer of the American West. Much of his literature deals with debunking myths of the West as a romantic country of heroes on horseback, and his passion for the terrain and its inhabitants have earned him the title 'The Dean of Western Letters'. He was one of the few true Men of Letters in this generation. An historian, essayist, short story writer and novelist, as well as a leading environmental writer. Although always connected in people's minds with the West, he had a long association with New England. Many short stories and one of his most successful novels, Crossing to Safety, are set in Vermont, where he had a summer home for many years. Another novel, <b>The Spectator Bird</b>, takes place in Denmark.</p><p><br>An early environmentalist, he actively championed the region's preservation and was instrumental-with his now-famous 'Wilderness Letter'-in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Honest and straightforward, educated yet unpretentious, cantankerous yet compassionate, <b>Wallace Stegner</b> was an enormous presence in the American literary landscape, a man who wrote and lived with ferocity, energy, and integrity.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jackson J. Benson</b> teaches American Literature at San Diego State University. His biography, <b>The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer</b>, won the PEN USA West award for nonfiction.

The first three--basic italic, formal italic, and chancery italic--are fairly standard calligraphy forms. The fourth style, cursive italic, is designed for use as everyday handwriting. Presented in the authors' previous books, the eight-volume Italic Handwriting Series (Continuing Education Pr., 1986), and Write Now ( LJ 3/1/91), this style was devised to facilitate the transition from printing to cursive writing. The format of this book, with practice space directly below the calligraphic examples (and instructions to use tracing paper), make comparison and correction easy.

Don&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;&nbsp;Patrick Anderson, <em>Washington Post Book World</em></strong></p><p>The optimism of the early sixties, infused with the excitement of the space race and the menace of the Cold War, is filtered through the rich imagination of high-spirited, eight-year-old Madeleine, who welcomes her family's posting to a quiet Air Force base near the Canadian border. Secure in the love of her beautiful mother, she is unaware that her father, Jack, is caught up in a web of secrets. When a local murder intersects with global forces, Jack must decide where his loyalties lie, and Madeleine will be forced to learn a lesson about the ambiguity of human morality -- one she will only begin to understand when she carries her quest for the truth, and the killer, into adulthood twenty years later.</p></p><p><i>The Way the Crow Flies</i>, Ann-Marie MacDonald's follow-up novel to her bestselling debut (and Oprah Book Club pick), <i>Fall on Your Knees</i>, opens in 1962 when the McCarthy family moves from Germany to their new home on a Canadian air force base near London, Ontario. Madeleine, eight and already a blossoming comic, is particularly close with her father, Jack, an air force officer. Her loving Acadian mother, Mimi, and older brother Mike round out this family, whose simple goodness reflects the glow of an era that seemed like paradise. But all that is about to change. The Cuban Missile Crisis is looming, and Jack, loyal and gullible, suddenly has an important task to carry out that involves a scientist--a former Nazi--in Canada.<p> While Jack scrambles to keep his activities hidden from his wife, Madeleine too is learning to keep secrets (about a teacher at school). <i>The Way the Crow Flies</i> is all about the fertility of lies, how one breeds another and another. Although the writing flows with a strong current, the profusion of pop references, especially ad slogans, grows tiresome. The author can, however, capture a lovely image in few words: "The afternoon intensifies. August is the true light of summer" and "yes, the earth is a woman, and her favorite food is corn." At times the story is marvelously compelling, as the mystery of a horrific murder in the fields near the base is unravelled. When events lead to a trial and its outcome, the story peaks, in a conclusion with no easy answers. The last third of the book takes place, for the most part, 20 years later. Here the novel meanders somewhat, losing its ability to captivate with the same intensity. The reader longs to return to the earlier world, which MacDonald has captured in vital detail. <i>--Mark Frutkin, Amazon.ca</i></p><i>?The sun came out after the war and our world went Technicolor. Everyone had the same idea. Let?s get married. Let?s have kids. Let?s be the ones who do it right.?<br></i> <br> <b>The Way the Crow Flies</b>, the second novel by bestselling, award-winning author Ann-Marie MacDonald, <i> </i>is set on the Royal Canadian Air Force station of Centralia during the early sixties. It is a time of optimism -- infused with the excitement of the space race but overshadowed by the menace of the Cold War -- filtered through the rich imagination and quick humour of eight-year-old Madeleine McCarthy and the idealism of her father, Jack, a career officer. <br> <br>As the novel opens, Madeleine?s family is driving to their new home; Centralia is her father?s latest posting. They have come back from the Old World of Germany to the New World of Canada, where the towns hold memories of the Europeans who settled there. For the McCarthys, it is ?the best of both worlds.? And they are a happy family. Jack and Mimi are still in love, Madeleine and her older brother, Mike, get along as well as can be expected. They all dance together and barbecue in the snow. They are compassionate and caring. Yet they have secrets. <br> <br>Centralia is the station where, years ago, Jack crashed his plane and therefore never went operational; instead of being killed in action in 1943, he became a manager. Although he is successful, enjoys ?flying a desk? and is thickening around the waist from Mimi?s good Acadian cooking, deep down Jack feels restless. His imagination is caught by the space race and the fight against Communism; he believes landing a man on the moon will change the world, and anything is possible. When his old wartime flying instructor appears out of the blue and asks for help with the secret defection of a Soviet scientist, Jack is excited to answer the call of duty: now he has a real job. <br> <br>Madeleine?s secret is ?the exercise group?. She is kept behind after class by Mr. March, along with other little girls, and made to do ?backbends? to improve her concentration. As the abusive situation worsens, she is convinced that she cannot tell her parents and risk disappointing them. No one suspects, even when Madeleine?s behaviour changes: in the early sixties people still believe that school is ?one of the safest places.? Colleen and Ricky, the adopted Metis children of her neighbours, know differently; at the school they were sent to after their parents died, they had been labelled ?retarded? because they spoke Michif. <br> <br>Then a little girl is murdered. Ricky is arrested, although most people on the station are convinced of his innocence. At the same time, Ricky?s father, Henry Froelich, a German Jew who was in a concentration camp, identifies the Soviet scientist hiding in the nearby town as a possible Nazi war criminal. Jack alone could provide Ricky?s alibi, but the Cold War stakes are politically high and doing ?the right thing? is not so simple. ?Show me the right thing and I will do it,? says Jack. As this very local murder intersects with global forces, <b>The Way the Crow Flies</b> <i> </i>reminds us that in time of war the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. <br> <br>Ann-Marie MacDonald said in a discussion with Oprah Winfrey about her first book, ?a happy ending is when someone can walk out of the rubble and tell the story.? Madeleine achieves her childhood dream of becoming a comedian, yet twenty years later she realises she cannot rest until she has renewed the quest for the truth, and confirmed how and why the child was murdered.. <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, <i> </i>in a starred review, called <b>The Way the Crow Flies</b> <i> </i>?absorbing, psychologically rich?a chronicle of innocence betrayed?. With compassion and intelligence, and an unerring eye for the absurd as well as the confusions of childhood, , MacDonald evokes the confusion of being human and the necessity of coming to terms with our imperfections.</p><h2>Pilot Academy</h2><p>Pilot Academy focuses on a different kind of pilot in each of its three sections: helicopter pilots, jet pilots and airline pilots.

Combining a video with Pilates is asking for poor muscular alignment and a lot of mental distraction, so while the kit's components may seem a little old-fashioned, they're both effective and appropriate. Two CDs and 70 illustrated flash cards work together to supply visual and oral cues for each exercise; a simple book and exercise journal complete the package. With a portable player, you'll have private instruction in public gyms or hotels without expensive classes or tight schedules. The first disk provides a solid grounding in the fundamentals and progresses up the ladder. Many postures are possible for everyone, regardless of fitness level, and it's also a good backup for advanced students if an accident or illness forces you to start again from scratch. The second disk takes you through the intermediate exercises, some of which may be difficult (or impossible) at first but remain inspiring--Siler's gentle authority and creative metaphors make it easy to visualize a day when we'll all be as lean, strong and flexible as she is. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Brook Siler was hailed by <i>Vogue</i> as on of America's most sought after Pilates trainers.

But when I did, I was drawn into the house. Starting with the second book of the series rather than the first actually made me into one of the characters of the book because I was new to the house. The house knew secrets that I thought would somehow be revealed to the occupants over time, but the house was silent. Each generation lived, echoing the generations before but never knowing the root of all they did. The story goes on just as life. A person is born. And the end of their story is that they die. And the world goes on. Each chapter is the story of an individual who comes to the house and becomes a part of its history, told in the first person. You love some characters and you hate others. And the house sees all and is silent. The end of the book you find, is just the end of another life. And you realize that the world continues and other stories will go onward. Reading The Town House, you realize that the stories in The House at Old Vine are going full circle in this tragic and comic thing we call life. Justice is not always found. Secrets are not always told. And the world lives with those results. You&#39;ll feel a part of these people&#39;s lives and realize that, even centuries ago, humans are just as human as you and I. And humans will go onward. My offspring will have offspring who will have offspring and my life will be forgotten, but the consequences of my life will likely follow themselves to the next generation.

Taking on a formidable array of constitutional scholars, with the Attorney General in the wings, he rebuts their argument with vigor and effectiveness, conclusively demonstrating the legitimacy of the incorporation thesis. He does so by placing the Amendment in the stew of history: by examining first the historical context, and then Republican ideology as reflected in legislative debate over the 13th and 14th amendments as well as over the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

Young, tough, patriotic but also disturbingly self-aware, he exulted in the war, which he saw not just as a great national struggle but - more importantly - as a unique personal struggle. Leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart, Junger kept testing himself, braced for the death that would mark his failure. Published shortly after the war&#39;s end, &#34;Storm of Steel&#34; was a worldwide bestseller and can now be rediscovered through Michael Hofmann&#39;s translation.</p><p>Ernst Junger, the son of a wealthy chemist, ran away from home to join the Foreign Legion. His father dragged him back, but he returned to military service when he joined the German army on the outbreak of the First World War. STORM OF STEEL was Junger&#39;s first book, published in 1920. Junger died in 1998.Undoubtedly the most powerful memoir of any war I have ever read ... Storm of Steel combines the most astonishing literary gifts with absorption with war in every detail. It has German loyalties and a German sensibility, but not a trace of propaganda. It is particular, yet universal ... What Junger saw and recorded was, to use his own word, &#39;primordial&#39;. It takes great art to convey that appalling simplicity -- Charles Moore * Telegraph * Storm of Steel is what so many books claim to be but are not: a classic account of war * Evening Standard * Hofmann&#39;s interpretation is superb * The Times * Unique in the literature of this or any other war is its brilliantly vivid conjuration of the immediacy and intensity of battle * Telegraph *</p><h2>Women and the Conquest of California, 1542-1840: Codes of Silence</h2><p><b>Studies of the Spanish conquest</b> in the Americas traditionally have explained European-Indian encounters in terms of such factors as geography, timing, and the charisma of individual conquistadores. Yet by reconsidering this history from the perspective of gender roles and relations, we see that gender ideology was a key ingredient in the glue that held the conquest together and in turn shaped indigenous behavior toward the conquerors. This book tells the hidden story of women during the missionization of California. It shows what it was like for women to live and work on that frontier&#x2014;and how race, religion, age, and ethnicity shaped female experiences. It explores the suppression of women's experiences and cultural resistance to domination, and reveals the many codes of silence regarding the use of force at the missions, the treatment of women, indigenous ceremonies, sexuality, and dreams.<br><br> Virginia Bouvier has combed a vast array of sources&#x2014; including mission records, journals of explorers and missionaries, novels of chivalry, and oral histories&#x2014; and has discovered that female participation in the colonization of California was greater and earlier than most historians have recognized. Viewing the conquest through the prism of gender, Bouvier gives new meaning to the settling of new lands and attempts to convert indigenous peoples. By analyzing the participation of women&#x2014; both Hispanic and Indian&#x2014; in the maintenance of or resistance to the mission system, Bouvier restores them to the narrative of the conquest, colonization, and evangelization of California. And by bringing these voices into the chorus of history, she creates new harmonies and dissonances that alter and enhance our understanding of both the experience and meaning of conquest.</p><p>This book tells the hidden story of women during the missionization of California.

Using a little intergrity, they have succeeded in transforming the simplest ingredients into mouth watering delicacies. Gujarati cuisine is a subtle blend of flavours and textures. All the three main regions of Gujarat have their own unique culinary styles. A Guajarati meal served in a thali is an experience by itself. Beginning with cumin spiked buttermilk, followed by fluffy rotis, accompanied by a variety of lentils (kathols), vegetables, curds, pickles, mithais and farsans finished with rice or khichdi. Apart from pampering the palate, it is also a well balanced meal. Most Guajarati recipes were traditionally handed down from mother to daughter and a very few attempts were made to document them. In the process much has been lost . at the same time as a result of improvisations made by each generation to suit their changing tastes and also to adopt to their lifestyles, there have also been many gains. This book is an attempt to document the classic recipes so that it can help both the inexperienced beginner as well as the connoisseur.</p><p>Mrs. Tarla Dalal is India s best - selling cookery author since over 2 decades.

His "political time" thesis has been particularly influential, revealing how presidents reckon with the work of their predecessors, situate their power within recent political events, and assert their authority in the service of change. In the original edition of this book, Skowronek revisited that thesis to make better sense of the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. In this new edition, he also addresses the first two years of Barack Obama's presidency.<br><br>Already considered a classic and widely used in courses on the presidency, Skowronek's book has greatly expanded our understanding of and debates over the politics of leadership. It clarifies the typical political problems that presidents confront in political time, as well as the likely effects of their working through them, and considers contemporary innovations in our political system that bear on the leadership patterns from the more distant past. Drawing out parallels in the politics of leadership between Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt and between James Polk and John Kennedy, it develops a new and revealing perspective on the presidential leadership of Clinton, Bush, and now Obama.<br><br>In this edition, Skowronek devotes an entirely new chapter to Obama's presidency and its prospects for becoming transformational-like the presidencies of Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, FDR, and Reagan, all of whom succeeded to varying degrees in reconstructing the playing field of national politics. Along the way, he wonders if this kind of leadership is still even possible, given the current divided state of the American polity. He also takes a fresh look at the impact of the twenty-four-hour news cycle, of a more disciplined and homogeneous Republican party, of conservative advocacy of the "unitary theory" of the executive, and of progressive disillusionment with the presidency as an institution.<br><br>A provocative review of presidential history, Skowronek's book brims with fresh insights and opens a window on the institution of the executive office and the workings of the American political system as a whole. Intellectually satisfying for scholars, it also provides an accessible volume for students and general readers interested in the American presidency.</p><p>"With this brilliant work, Skowronek scans the centuries to illuminate the dynamics that have made some presidents the master of political time--and others its victim."--Ron Brownstein, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> national affairs columnist <p>"A brilliant, provocative reading of presidential history that sparkles with originality and insight."--Richard Ellis, author of <i>Founding the American Presidency</i></p>Stephen Skowronek is Pelatiah Perit Professor of Political Science at Yale University.

For botanists, naturalists, and students interested in an up-to-date treatment of the vascular flora of greater New England, it has proved to be an invaluable resource. The geographic scope of the work extends from the Canadian border south through Long Island and west to the Hudson River. The &#34;General Keys&#34; section contains fourteen keys that include such groups as aquatic plants, vines, and woody plants in winter condition. For both woody and herbaceous families, the keys cover flowering as well as fruiting conditions and rely heavily on the use of vegetative features to extend the utility of the book beyond the reproductive period. The &#34;Descriptive Flora&#34; section includes keys to all of the genera and species, descriptions of the families and genera, and accounts of the individual species. The latter incorporates information on wetland site index, rare status, wildlife food value, food and medicinal value for humans, and poisonous or hallucinogenic properties. This revised edition includes an updating of plant scientific names that changed since the first edition and an alphabetized list of plant families with page numbers on the inside front cover for easy reference. This edition also includes a new CD-ROM with a multiple-entry identification guide, hundreds of accompanying photographic images of genera, an illustrated glossary, and page reference numbers to genus descriptions in the manual. Presenting a wealth of scientifically accurate information in a precise and clear format, this volume serves as a reference work, as a textbook for classes in plant identification, and as a field manual.</p><p>Dennis W.

He is one of the symp-toms of our times&#x2014;from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?<br><br>This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York&#x2019;s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic&#x2014;his congenital incapacity for friendship.<br><br>An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.<br><br>When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick&#x2019;s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.</p><p>Budd Schulberg wrote <i>On the Waterfront</i>, made into a movie starring Marlon Brando, and <i>The Harder They Fall</i>, made into a movie starring Humphrey Bogart. He won an Oscar for the screenplay of <i>On the Waterfront</i> several awards for his film <i>A Face in the Crowd</i>, and a Tony nomination for his Broadway adaptation of <i>The Disenchanted</i>. He attributed his ability to adapt his own work to stage or screen to his upbringing in Hollywood, where his father ran a major motion-picture studio. He died in 2009 at the age of 95.</p><h2>Carry on</h2><p>Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who&#39;s ever been chosen. That&#39;s what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he&#39;s probably right. Half the time, Simon can&#39;t even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor&#39;s avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there&#39;s a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon&#39;s face.

The result is a deeply original tour de force that springs from Twain&#x2019;s classic novel but takes on a fully realized life of its own.<br><br><i>Finn</i> sets a tragic figure loose in a landscape at once familiar and mythic. It begins and ends with a lifeless body&#x2013;flayed and stripped of all identifying marks&#x2013;drifting down the Mississippi. The circumstances of the murder, and the secret of the victim&#x2019;s identity, shape Finn&#x2019;s story as they will shape his life and his death.<br><br>Along the way Clinch introduces a cast of unforgettable characters: Finn&#x2019;s terrifying father, known only as the Judge; his sickly, sycophantic brother, Will; blind Bliss, a secretive moonshiner; the strong and quick-witted Mary, a stolen slave who becomes Finn&#x2019;s mistress; and of course young Huck himself. In daring to re-create Huck for a new generation, Clinch gives us a living boy in all his human complexity&#x2013;not an icon, not a myth, but a real child facing vast possibilities in a world alternately dangerous and bright.<br><br><i>Finn </i>is a novel about race; about paternity in its many guises; about the shame of a nation recapitulated by the shame of one absolutely unforgettable family. Above all, Finn reaches back into the darkest waters of America&#x2019;s past to fashion something compelling, fearless, and new. <br><br>Praise for <i>Finn</i><br>&#x201c;A brave and ambitious debut novel... It stands on its own while giving new life and meaning to Twain&#x2019;s novel, which has been stirring passions and debates since 1885... triumph of imagination and graceful writing.... Bookstores and libraries shelve novels alphabetically by authors&#x2019; names. That leaves Clinch a long way from Twain. But on my bookshelves, they'll lean against each other. I&#x2019;d like to think that the cantankerous Twain would welcome the company.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>USA TODAY<br></i><br>&#x201c;Ravishing...In the saga of this tormented human being, Clinch brings us a radical (and endlessly debatable) new take on Twain&#x2019;s classic, and a stand-alone marvel of a novel.

Clinch has a knack for putting us squarely inside the heads of his characters....Clinch draws as compelling and realistic a picture as any we&#x2019;re likely to find...<i>Finn</i> stands on its own. The richness of its language, the depth of its characters, the emotional and societal tangles through which they struggle to navigate add up to a portrait of life on the Mississippi as we&#x2019;ve never before experienced it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>dallas morning news<br></i><br>&#x201c;His models may include Cormac McCarthy, and Charles Frazier, whose <i>Cold Mountain </i>also has a voice that sounds like 19th-century American (both formal and colloquial) but has a contemporary terseness and spikiness. This voice couldn&#x2019;t be better suited to a historical novel with a modernist sensibility: Clinch&#x2019;s riverbank Missouri feels postapocalyptic, and his Pap Finn is a crazed yet wily survivor in a polluted landscape...Clinch&#x2019;s Pap is a convincingly nightmarish extrapolation of Twain&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;s the mad, lost and dangerous center of a world we&#x2019;d hate to live in&#x2013;or do we <i>still</i> live there?&#x2013;and crave to revisit as soon as we close the book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>newsweek<br><br></i>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been swallowed whole by a work of fiction in some time. Jon Clinch&#x2019;s first novel has done it: sucked me under like I was a rag doll thrown into the wake of a Mississippi steamboat...Jon Clinch has turned in a nearly perfect first book, a creative response that matches <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> in intensity and tenacious soul-searching about racism. I wish I could write well enough to construct a dramatic, subtle and mysterious story out of careful, plodding and unromantic prose, but for now I&#x2019;m just happy to have an alchemist like Jon Clinch do it for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>BOOKSLUT<br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>Finn</i> strikes its most original chords in its bold imagining of possibilities left unexplored by <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>austin american-statesman<br><br></i>&#x201c;An inspired riff on one of literature&#x2019;s all-time great villains...This tale of fathers and sons, slavery and freedom, better angels at war with dark demons, is filled with passages of brilliant description, violence that is close-up and terrifying...Everything in this novel could have happened, and we believe it... so the great river of stories is too, twisting and turning, inspiring such surprising and inspired riffs and tributes as <i>Finn</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>new orleans times-picayune<br><br></i>&#x201c;A triumph of succesful plotting, convincing characterization and lyrical prose.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS<br><br></i>&#x201c;Shocking and charming. Clinch creates a folk-art masterpiece that will delight, beguile and entertain as it does justice to its predecessor...In <i>Finn</i>, Clinch expands the bloodlines and scope of the original story and casts new light on the troubled legacy of our country&#x2019;s infamous past.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>new york post<br><br></i>&#x201c;In Clinch&#x2019;s retelling, Pap Finn comes vibrantly to life as a complex, mysterious, strangely likable figure...Clinch includes many sharply realized, sometimes harrowing, even gruesome scenes...<i>Finn</i> should appeal not only to scholars of 19th century literature but to anyone who cares to sample a forceful debut novel inspired by a now-mythic American story.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>atlanta journal-consitution<br><br></i>&#x201c;What makes bearable this river voyage that never ventures far beyond the banks is the compelling narrative Clinch has created.

A few incidents duplicate those in Twain, <br>but the novels could not be more different; instead of Huck&#x2019;s unlettered child&#x2019;s voice, <br>we have an omniscient narrative, grave, erudite and rich in the secretions of adult knowledge; <br>terse dialogue acts as an effective counterpoint.

It&#x2019;s a great read.&#x201d; <br><i>&#x2013;Knoxville News Sentinel<br></i></p><p>A native of upstate New York and a graduate of Syracuse University, <b>Jon Clinch</b> has taught American literature, has been creative director for a Philadelphia ad agency, and has run his own agency in the Philadelphia suburbs. His stories have appeared in John Gardner's <i>MSS.</i> magazine. He and his wife have one daughter.Chapter 1 <br>Under a low sun, pursued by fish and mounted by crows and veiled in a loud languid swarm of bluebottle flies, the body comes down the river like a deadfall stripped clean. <br>It proceeds as do all things moving down the Mississippi in the late summer of the year, at a stately pace, as if its blind eyes were busy taking in the blue sky piled dreamily deep with cloud. There will be thunder by suppertime and rain to last the whole night long but just now the early day is brilliant and entirely without flaw. How long the body has been floating would be a mystery if any individual had yet taken note of its passage and mused so upon it, but thus far, under that sky of blue and white and upon this gentle muddy bed aswarm with a school of sunfish and one or two smallmouth bass darting warily as thieves, it has passed only empty fields and stands of willow and thick brushy embankments uninhabited. <br>A crow screams and flaps off, bearing an eye as brown and deep as the Mississippi herself. <br>Sunday morning, early, and the river is without traffic. <br>An alligator gar, eight feet if it&#x2019;s an inch, rises deathlike from the bottom and fastens its long jaw upon a hipbone, which snaps like rotten wood and comes away. The body entire goes under a time or two, bobbing and turning, the eggs of blowflies scattering into the water like thrown rice. The urgent sunfish eddy. The bluebottles hover, endlessly patient, and when the body has recovered its equilibrium and resumed its downward course they settle once more. <br>Boys note its passage first, boys from the village taking the long way to Sunday school, and their witness is as much nature&#x2019;s way as is the slow dissolution of the floating body into the stratified media of air and water. The corpse is not too very far from shore and clearly neither dog nor deer nor anything but man. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet it&#x2019;s old Finn,&#x201d; says one of them, Joe or Tom or Bill or perhaps some other. On this Sunday morning down by the riverbank they are as alike as polished stones. &#x201c;My pap says they&#x2019;ll fish him from the river one day for sure.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; says another. <br>&#x201c;Yes sir. A worthless old drunk like that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; says the other again. He picks up a flat stone and tests it in his hand, eyeing the crow, which has returned and sunken its beak into a pocket of flesh. &#x201c;Shows how much you know. That ain&#x2019;t even a man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I reckon you think it&#x2019;s a mule.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a woman, no question.&#x201d; <br>The lot of them go jostling together and squinting into the sunrise and blinking against the glare on the water as if the only thing superior to the floating corpse of a man would be the floating corpse of a woman, as if seeking in unison for a lesson in anatomy and never mind the cost. <br>Finally, from one of them or another but in the end from the childish heart in each save the learned one, this confession: &#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Men float facedown. Anybody knows that.&#x201d; Skipping the stone across the water to flush the crow, ruining his good trousers with the offhand brush of muddy fingers. <br>They draw straws, and as the unlucky boy lights out toward the village to enlist an adult the rest of them locate a skiff and cast off and make for the body. They hook her with a willow switch, these boys inured to dead things, and they drag her like bait to shore. One of them has been keeping a dead cat on a string for a week now, a kitten really, just a poor stiff dried husk won exactly this way, string and all, in a game of mumblety-peg. <br>The corpse floats low in the water, bottoming out in the mud that sucks at heel and buttock and drooping wrist. During its journey down the river it has failed to swell in the common way of corpses left in the sun. It lacks for skin, all of it, from scalp to sole. Nothing remains but sinew and bone and scraps of succulent yellow fat that the crows have not yet torn free. <br>One boy panics and loses his balance and falls into the water, his clothes spoiled for Sunday. <br>The bootlegger stirs his fire, oblivious to the sparks that circle upward into the night sky. He hears everything, every whisper in the dry grass of the pathway that leads from behind his shack, every snapping twig in the surrounding woods, every wingbeat of sparrow or jay or owl. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t steal whiskey from old Bliss,&#x201d; he likes to say, as if anyone would stoop so low as to steal whiskey from a blind man. <br>He repeats this reassurance now to Finn, who has proven him wrong before. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so,&#x201d; says Finn. <br>Pleased with himself, Bliss cackles until he coughs. Then he spits between his crooked teeth into the fire, where the sputum lands with a satisfying sizzle. &#x201c;You got a jug?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Course I got a jug.&#x201d; Finn is as regular around these premises as the weather, even more regular than Bliss knows. But tonight his first purpose is neither to buy whiskey nor to steal it but to dispose of something in Bliss&#x2019;s perpetual fire. He has a tow sack between his feet, filthy even in the firelight and slowly leaking something into the dust. He bumps the blind man&#x2019;s knee with his jug, a signal. <br>&#x201c;Go on get it yourself,&#x201d; says Bliss. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m occupied?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tend. You pour. Give me that stick.&#x201d; <br>Bliss won&#x2019;t let it go. &#x201c;Leave an old man be. I reckon you know where I keep it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I reckon I do, if I could find it in the dark.&#x201d; <br>He has a point, so Bliss hands over the stick and limps off into the woods muttering to himself like an old priest. <br>Finn unties the tow sack and lays out its contents, long strips dark and dimly glistening, pieces of flayed flesh identically sliced save one. Their regularity in width and length and thickness speaks of a huntsman&#x2019;s easy skill and a plotter&#x2019;s furtive patience and something else too. He chooses one and throws it upon the fire, where it sizzles and smokes and curls in upon itself as sinuously as a lie. <br>&#x201c;Hope you brought some for me,&#x201d; says Bliss from the depths of the woods. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty.&#x201d; Throwing another piece into the fire to blacken. &#x201c;Bring a couple of them jars when you come back. We&#x2019;ll have ourselves a time.&#x201d; <br>Bliss, weighed down with Finn&#x2019;s crockery jug of forty-rod, adjusts his course and shuffles down the path toward the cabin. Halfway along he uses his head at last, plants the jug midpath like a tombstone, and makes for home unencumbered, counting off the paces so as not to stub his unshod foot during the journey back. <br>By firelight Finn locates the piece he&#x2019;s set aside for his host. He clears hot ash from a rock and places it there in the manner of an offering. <br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t had nothing but beans all week,&#x201d; says Bliss as he squats on his log. He swirls whiskey to cleanse a pair of canning jars. One of them is cracked about the rim and fit to tear someone&#x2019;s lip, and this one Bliss chooses for himself as long as Finn is paying. He minds the crack with his thumb. Bliss is a poor drinker and he knows it. Not mean like Finn, but morose and persistent and beyond satisfying. &#x201c;A little of your fatback would&#x2019;ve gone good with them beans.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll like it well enough plain,&#x201d; says Finn. <br>Bliss sniffs the air with satisfaction and mutters something unintelligible, pours himself another whiskey. <br>&#x201c;You be sparing with that.&#x201d; But Finn doesn&#x2019;t mean it and he knows that Bliss will pay him no mind anyhow. Once you get Bliss started there&#x2019;s no slowing him down until the jug is empty. &#x201c;Besides, I ain&#x2019;t paid for it yet.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry none. I&#x2019;ll put it on your account.&#x201d; Tapping the side of his head with a finger. <br>They sit in silence while the meat cooks. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve broken it off with that woman,&#x201d; says Finn. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made such a claim before.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This time I mean it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I reckon we will.&#x201d; <br>Bliss points his nose toward the spot where the meat sizzles on the fire just as surely as if he had two good eyes to guide it. &#x201c;When&#x2019;ll that be ready, you suppose? I don&#x2019;t want it burnt.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Soon.&#x201d; Tossing in another strip or two. <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t no good to me burnt.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hold your water.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying. Yours must be about black by now. The one you put up while I was in them woods.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t having any. She&#x2019;s all yours, on account of how good you&#x2019;ve always been to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aww. Tain&#x2019;t nothing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A token of my gratitude.&#x201d; <br>Bliss smiles in the odd unself-conscious way of one who has never looked into a mirror and learned thus to confine his expressions to the social norm. &#x201c;So how long was you with her, Finn?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ten, twelve years maybe. Fifteen, off and on.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Offer and onner, like they say.&#x201d; He puts down his empty jar and rubs his hands together in a fit of glee, his whole brain a lovely jumble of women and fatback bacon. &#x201c;What&#x2019;ll the Judge think?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say.&#x201d; Stabbing the flesh with a sharp stick and flipping it over. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve steered him wrong before.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Me, I don&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;ll ever make a dent in that Judge. He knows what he knows.&#x201d; <br>Finn grunts. <br>&#x201c;Your daddy&#x2019;s one judge that&#x2019;s got his mind made up.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been that way all my life.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He was that way before you was born, Finn. It ain&#x2019;t none of your doing.&#x201d; He hawks and spits into the fire, and Finn throws in some more pieces. &#x201c;Sure it ain&#x2019;t done yet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just about. Have some more whiskey.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind if I do.&#x201d; <br>After a while Finn stabs the meat and places it upon a flat stone that he bumps against the bootlegger&#x2019;s knee a time or two. &#x201c;Can you set down that whiskey long enough to eat?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do my best,&#x201d; says Bliss. Which he manages, just barely. And until half past midnight, while the silence in the woods deepens and the white moon looms and recedes and the owls grow weary at last of pursuing their prey through black air, the fire consumes Finn&#x2019;s secret. Come noon Bliss will awaken on the hard ground, and in his mind Finn&#x2019;s presence will have taken on the quality of a ghostly visitation. <br>He is between worlds, this boy. Between the river and the town, between the hogshead and the house, between the taint of his mother and the stain of his pap. He knows some things that he can never say, not even to himself. <br>He has trained his companions well&#x2014;these boys forbidden to associate with him on account of his mother&#x2019;s suspected stigma and his father&#x2019;s famed trouble with whiskey, these boys who associate with him nonetheless and perhaps all the more intently for being forbidden his company although they do not generally encounter him at school or at church or at any of the other places ordinarily deemed suitable for boys of the village. They find his dark history as dizzying as a leap from some great bluff into a Mississippi pool and his scrapes with his violent pap as thrilling as a narrow escape from Injun Joe&#x2019;s cave and his deep broad knowledge of woodsman&#x2019;s lore and slave&#x2019;s superstition as enchanting as a spell of protection against nightwalking spirits or werewolves, these boys forbidden to play with him yet drawn into his wake like needles to a lodestone, these boys whom he has trained well enough that at least one of them knows what he&#x2019;ll say before he says it and indeed has said it already, that the body is not a man&#x2019;s at all on account of it floats faceup. <br>When he can extricate himself from the widow&#x2019;s he sleeps in a great barrel nearly as tall as a man and twice as big around, a sugar hogshead washed up among the rushes at the edge of the village. The barrel lies upon its side and he lies upon his side within it. Sometimes he locates a place between the staves where the rain and the riverwater and the barrel&#x2019;s former purpose have conspired to leave behind a concealed crusty ridge of old sugar solidified, and with his clasp-knife he pries it loose for the pleasure of sucking upon it while he drifts off to sleep. <br>In the end it falls to the undertaker to load the corpse upon a wagon and remove it from the indignity of public display. Except perhaps for O&#x2019;Toole, the giant who owns the slaughterhouse in the next county, there is none other who might possess the stomach for it. So here he is, rolling the sticky fly-blown thing into a square of old canvas and wrangling it up onto the bed of his wagon as if it were the featureless corpse of a slug and he an ant, strong beyond his size. His name is Swope, he is rail-thin and dressed in rusty black, and he has been a fixture in the village of St. Petersburg for longer than anyone can remember. From long association he has acquired both the air of death and some of its permanence, and his pale hair bursts from under the brim of his slouch hat like a pile of sunbleached straw. <br>The corpse for its part is well mannered, patient, and perfectly amenable. Leached clean of all fluids, it barely stains the canvas tarpaulin. <br>Swope mutters to himself as he works, complaining about the hour and the uncharacteristic heat and the unfairness of the world. He has long made a habit of talking to himself, since no one else will do it. The children believe that he speaks to Death, which hovers invisibly over one of his shoulders or the other, although their parents believe instead that he addresses his harmless old horse, Alma. <br>&#x201c;As if I weren&#x2019;t busy enough without goddamn half-pay charity cases come floating downstream. Won&#x2019;t barely cover my expenses, may God damn the goodness of my goddamn bleeding heart, but who in hell else is going to do it? And at this time of the morning, as if the old gal couldn&#x2019;t have kept till noon. A feller gets himself the idea to go skin somebody like a goddamn rabbit at least he ought to have the decency to set something by for the proper obsequies, mail it anonymous to the paper or the marshal or some such. A goddamn crime is what it is. The feller what done it deserves to be tried as much for one as for the other. Pitiful goddamn half-pay charity case.&#x201d;</p><h2>Knitted Lace of Estonia with DVD: Techniques, Patterns, and Traditions</h2><p>Deepen your knowledge of lace knitting with 14 Estonian, heirloom quality lace patterns from Nancy Bush in a new edition of her bestselling book <i>Knitted Lace of Estonia</i>.

As they travel through the landscape of their often conflicting ambitions, Ann and Adele bring to life a novel that is a brilliant exploration of the perennial urge to keep moving, even at the risk of profound disorientation. Simpson&#39;s first novel is ultimately a heart-rendering tale of a mother and daughter&#39;s invaluable relationship. &#34;Mona Simpson writes with confidence, with swagger. She is already a master.&#34; - Anne Tyler &#34;Anywhere But Here is a wonder: big, complex, masterfully written, it&#39;s an achievement that lands [Simpson] in the front ranks of our best novelists.&#34; - Newsweek</p><p>"Strangers always love my mother," Ann August tells us at the start of <i>Anywhere But Here</i>. "And even if you hate her, can't stand her, even if she's ruining your life, there's something about her, some romance, some power. She's absolutely herself. No matter how hard you try, you'll never get to her. And when she dies, the world will be flat, too simple, reasonable, fair." Indeed, over the course of the dozen or so years chronicled in Mona Simpson's first novel, Ann and everyone else related to the charming, delusional Adele learn this the hard way. Ann does hate her at times; Adele does indeed come pretty close to ruining Ann's life on numerous occasions, or at least scarring it, and yet, ultimately, it isn't possible not to love her. As Ann puts it: "The thing about my mother and me is that when we get along we're just the same."<p> This is a woman who uproots her child from Wisconsin and moves to Los Angeles, leaving behind a dull husband (not Ann's father--who wandered off long ago but makes appearances here in memories), under the premise that life will be beautiful and Ann will become a famous television star. But her lifelong dream and goal ("It was our secret, a nighttime whispered promise" turns out, like so many things in the Augusts' lives, to be lackluster when it becomes reality. Adele merely feeds on fantasy and drags her daughter along. </p><p> Nevertheless, it's hard not to worship her. We hear from her mother, her sister, from Ann, and finally from Adele herself, and no matter how she's used people, what trouble she's gotten into, or what lies she's told--and there are plenty of all three--a certain amount of awe always remains. When we come upon Ann's proclamation that "it's always the people like my mother, who start the noise and bang things, who make you feel the worst; they are the ones who get your love." It's startling to realize how heartily we agree with her. <i>Anywhere But Here</i> gives truth to this statement in a way that few books ever have. It's dense with misery and amazement all tangled together--a realistic and thus rare portrait of love. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Anywhere But Here is a moving, often comic portrait of wise child Ann August and her mother, Adele, a larger-than-life American dreamer.

His work remains the Platonic ideal and template for contemporary &#x2018;luthiers&#x2019;; present day technology may hope to match but not alter the standard of such craftsmanship. Extant examples of the master&#x2019;s instruments are numerous&#x2014;but cellos from the &#x2018;great period&#x2019; (1707&#x2013;1720) are relatively few. The Countess of Stanlein-ex Paganini Stradivarius violoncello of 1707 is one of the best known in this exalted group. It has been copied often, physically dissected, discovered in a barrow on its way to a municipal dump, owned by Paganini, and applauded in hall after hall.<br><br>Today the &#x2018;Stanlein&#x2019; belongs to the cellist Bernard Greenhouse. In his eighties and semi-retired, he determined &#x2018;to give back something of value to the world of music that had given him so much.&#x2019; In September 1998 he deposited the cello in the New York atelier of virtuoso luthier Rene Morel. The craft of instrument repair remains rooted in tradition; its practitioners belong to a quasi-mediaeval guild. Morel began a complete restoration of the instrument, a painstaking and meticulous enterprise that took him nearly two years. This book tracks that process&#x2014;the intricacies, anxieties and pleasures that precede the cello&#x2019;s triumphal unveiling at the World Cello Congress in June 2000. Its subject is a work of art that must prove nonetheless functional, for the Countess of Stanlein-ex Paganini Stradivarius is only itself when played.</p><p><b>Nicholas Delbanco</b> is a British-born American who received his BA from Harvard and his MA from Columbia University.

In the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, when the rent was dirt cheap, people moved to be closer to a new job, away from an old lover, or when it seemed that a fundamental change of life was in order. Sometimes the person moving would not only change the numbers on his or her door but also the name on the mailbox, the used car in the driveway, and even the style of clothes they donned to walk out and meet the day.<br><br>Now and then the move was not merely aesthetic or convenient but necessary; like when a bill collector, lawyer, or the law itself was hot on the temporary tenant&#x2019;s trail. At a time like this the migrant leaseholder would make sure that the new domicile was inside the border of a different unincorporated town or municipality of L.A. County. That way the law offered few systems to track his whereabouts. A man could actually avoid dunning or even arrest by merely moving across the street.<br><br>In the case of a necessary move, the rental ï¿½migrï¿½ would load up a truck in the middle of the night and go with no fanfare, or notice to the landlord.<br><br>This was not the case with my midmorning migration.<br><br>My daughter and I were moving, that Sunday, from Genesee at Pico to Point View just a few houses north of Airdrome; not more than eleven blocks. This was a necessary move that was not due to any legal or monetary bureaucracy.<br><br>Five months or so earlier I had almost died. At that time I had been involved in a case that put my home in jeopardy, and so I had sent my daughter to stay with her brother at a friend&#x2019;s place, temporarily. I resolved the case but then drove my car off the side of a coastal mountain. Whether this accident was due to a subconscious death wish or just bad luck is uncertain, but I was in what the doctors called a semicoma for the better part of two months.<br><br>During that time a squatter named Jeffrey had taken possession of the empty house on Genesee. With the help of my friend Raymond Alexander, Jeff was put out. This was not a gentle eviction and I worried that Feather, my adopted daughter, might one day be home alone when the squatter returned for revenge.<br><br>And so I sold the Genesee house and bought a new, larger place on Point View. I might have ranged farther but that September, Feather was going to enter the seventh grade at Louis Pasteur Junior High and the new address was just a block away from there.<br><br>And so some friends&#x2014;ï¿½LaMarque Alexander (Raymond&#x2019;s son), Jesus (my adopted boy, now a young man), Jackson Blue and his wife&#x2019;s associate Percy Bidwell&#x2014;ï¿½helped Feather and me load our belongings into a rented truck and drive it over to the new door.<br><br>I would have hired a moving company but recently, within the last week, the city had seen fit to inspect all five of the rental properties I owned and demanded I fix structural problems, perform a termite-ï¿½extermination, and in one place they even required that I install a new heating system. It would take every cent I had, and then some, to pay for the improvements, so I rented a truck from my old pal Primo and called on my friends to lend a hand with the move.<br><br>Feather set herself up in the entranceway of the rare two-ï¿½story residence and directed the men where to deposit the bureaus, tables, beds, boxes, and chairs. My daughter had light brown hair and skin. She was tall for twelve and lean, not to say thin. She was becoming an accomplished long-ï¿½distance runner as her brother, Jesus, had been, and was fluent in three languages already. Neither she nor her brother had one drop of blood in common with me, or each other, but they were my kids and we were family.<br><br>&#x201c;Uncle Jackson,&#x201d; Feather said from the front hall, &#x201c;that little table goes in Daddy&#x2019;s room upstairs. He uses it for his desk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Upstairs?&#x201d; Jackson exclaimed. He was around my age, mid-ï¿½forties, short, jet black, and skinny as a sapling tree. &#x201c;Girl, this table might look little but the wood is dense, and heavy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help, Uncle J,&#x201d; Jesus said. My boy was pure Mexican Indian. He was no taller than Jackson Blue but his years of working his own small fishing boat had made him strong.<br><br>Jesus got behind the table, taking most of the weight, and Jackson groaned piteously as he guided it up the stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a really nice house you got here, Mr. Rawlins,&#x201d; Percy Bidwell said.<br><br>He was almost my height, a brassy brown, and good-ï¿½looking. His hair had been processed into tight curls. I always distrusted men who processed their hair. This was a prejudice that I realized was not necessarily justified.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Percy. I like it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jewelle said that you haven&#x2019;t moved in years. I guess this house was just too good to pass up. Must&#x2019;ve cost quite a bit for a place this big in this neighborhood.&#x201d;<br><br>I also didn&#x2019;t like people asking about my business. Percy was racking up the negative points on my friendship register.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you work for Jewelle?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He seemed almost insulted by the question.<br><br>Jewelle MacDonald had come from a real estate family and on her own had amassed an empire of apartment buildings and commercial properties. She was even part-ï¿½owner of a major international hotel that was being constructed in downtown L.A. Jewelle was barely out of her twenties and married to the onetime roustabout, now computer expert Jackson Blue. It was no insult to ask if Bidwell worked for her. She had sent him to help Jackson, after all.<br><br>&#x201c;Jewelle told me that if I wanted to get in contact with Jason Middleton,&#x201d; Percy said, &#x201c;that you were the one who would do that for me.&#x201d;<br><br>His sentence structure told me that he thought that I was somehow under the direction of Jewelle; that all he had to do was mention that she had asked for something and I would make that something happen.<br><br>I turned away from him and called, &#x201c;LaMarque!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Rawlins?&#x201d;<br><br>The lanky twenty-ï¿½two-ï¿½year-ï¿½old loped from the truck to my side.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your father?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He had to go back east on business.&#x201d;<br><br>Business for Raymond, more commonly known as Mouse, was high-ï¿½end heists with the strong possibility of brutality and bloodshed.<br><br>&#x201c;So he sent you to take his place?&#x201d; I asked. I could feel Percy Bidwell starring daggers at my back.<br><br>&#x201c;Mama did. When you called to ask for Dad to help, she send me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long you been back from Texas?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nine days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You outta all that trouble now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t in no gang no more,&#x201d; he said, looking down a little sheepishly.<br><br>EttaMae, LaMarque&#x2019;s mother and Raymond&#x2019;s wife, had sent the young man down to Texas to work on her brother&#x2019;s farm for a while. She did that to save the lives of the gang members who had tried to claim him as one of their own. Raymond would have killed them all if she hadn&#x2019;t interfered.<br><br>A car pulled up to the curb just then. It was a dark Ford with four male passengers. Most cars in Southern California transported a solitary driver, a couple, a double date, or a family. Four men in a car most likely spelled trouble if there wasn&#x2019;t a construction site somewhere in the vicinity.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said to LaMarque while watching the men confer, &#x201c;you get back to work and I&#x2019;ll give you twenty dollars to go home with.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; he said. Etta had taught the boy his manners.<br><br>LaMarque ducked his head and ran back to the truck.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Rawlins,&#x201d; Percy Bidwell said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, Percy?&#x201d; I was watching the men as they prepared to disembark.<br><br>&#x201c;About Mr. Middleton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it you want with Jason?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s private,&#x201d; the young man said.<br><br>&#x201c;Then you better just call him up yourself and leave me out of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t know you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jewelle told me to tell you to call him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t tell me what to do, son, and neither does Jewelle.&#x201d;<br><br>The four men were out of the car by then. They were all white men, tall, and burly. Three of them wore off-ï¿½the-ï¿½rack suits of various dark hues. The eldest, maybe fifty years of age, was dressed in a dark-ï¿½colored, tailored ensemble that was possibly even silk.<br><br>The leader began the stroll up the slight incline of my lawn.<br><br>&#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; Jackson warned from an upstairs window.<br><br>&#x201c;I see &#x2019;em, Blue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Rawlins,&#x201d; Percy was saying, trying once again to impress his will upon me.<br><br>&#x201c;Either get back to work or go home, Percy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I got other things on my mind right now.&#x201d;</p><h2>Geis of the Gargoyle (Xanth)</h2><p>Seeking a spell that will restore the polluted river Swan Knee to a state of purity, guardian Gary Gargoyle finds himself face-to-face with the Good Magician Humphrey. 75,000 first printing. $75,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Piers Anthony is one of the world's most popular fantasy authors, and a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller twenty-one times over.

The debate has raged up to the present day. Yet Liebow&#39;s shadow theory of values_especially the values of poor, urban, black men-_remains the single most parsimonious account of the reasons why the behavior of the poor appears to be at odds with the values of the American mainstream. While Elliot Liebow&#39;s vivid narrative of &#39;street-corner&#39; black men remains unchanged, the new introductions to this long-awaited revised edition bring the book up to date. Wilson and Lemert describe the debates since 1965 and situate Liebow&#39;s classic text in respect to current theories of urban poverty and race. They account for what Liebow might have seen had he studied the street corner today after welfare has been virtually ended and the drug economy had taken its toll. They also take stock of how the new global economy is a source of added strain on the urban poor. Discussion of field methods since the 1960s rounds out the book&#39;s new coverage.</p><p>Elliot Liebow (1925-1994) served as chief of the Center for the Study of Work and Mental Health of the National Institute of Mental Health. Liebow wrote Tally&#39;s Corner as his Ph.D. dissertation at the Catholic University of America. He also published Tell Them Who I Am, a study of homeless women in America, in 1993.<i>Tally's Corner</i> is an important book for anyone seeking to understand America. (Herbert Gans, author of Democracy and the News)<br><br>Whenever and wherever people come out of the dark to face the shadow of America's befuddled relation to the Black man of the city, <i>Tally's Corner</i> is somewhere on the penumbra of consciousness, serving as a lifeline against the currents of ill-informed racist blather about urban poverty. . . . The story of the Black man of the city is ultimately the story of the modern city itself, and in turn of the postmodern global economy. It is a story that is nowhere near its final chapter.

Greer argues that women have come a long way in the past three decades, but that innumerable forms of insidious discrimination and exploitation persist in every area of life--from the care of the body to the care of the household, from the workplace to the marketplace. She startles us with her demonstration that the oft-repeated claim that "women can have it all" is merely a pacifying illusion--that things are getting worse, and that action is necessary now. <br><br><b>The Whole Woman</b> is a shattering critique of the complacency and denial that have replaced feminist determination and militancy, and of a society that has done little to maintain the momentum for change. It is also a call to arms--forceful and impossible to ignore.</p><p>For women born in the immediate postwar period, there were the years BG and AG--"before Greer" and "after Greer." It's all too easy to underestimate its influence, but the fact is that in 1970 every self-respecting woman on the Left owned a copy of <i>The Female Eunuch</i>. Thirty years later, Germaine Greer is ready to get angry again. In <i>The Whole Woman</i>, she analyzes, among other issues, the invasive ways in which the health industry persuades women to have their bodies and reproductive systems "managed." Greer lays out the facts about the high failure rate and devastating side effects of in vitro fertilization and the incongruence between the "success" of breast implants in achieving the "perfect" mammary to please men and the continuing failures in detecting and treating increasingly prevalent breast cancer. <p> Greer's polemic has the confident virtuosity of wit and maturity. Celebrating women's successes, <i>The Whole Woman</i> is a more positive book than <i>The Female Eunuch</i>. Her unique combination of outrageous humor and assertiveness continues to lead the way forward for women who want to take control of their lives. <i>--Lisa Jardine, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"Compulsively readable."--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"Right on."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"She is deliberately irate and humorous, challenging and disarming as she seeks to undermine firmly held beliefs."--<i>Newsday</i></p><h2>Melvin Monster: Volume One (John Stanley Library)</h2><p><p>The classic children's comic strip in a handsome new archival series, designed by Seth</p><p>John Stanley is celebrated as one of the great children's comics writers for his work on the Little Lulu series.

Who&#x2019;s to say my traumatized mind didn&#x2019;t just make them up, or pull them out from somewhere else, some other slot, and stick them there to plug the gap&#x2014;the crater&#x2014;that the accident had blown? Minds are versatile and wily things. Real chancers.<br><br>And then there&#x2019;s the Requirement. The Clause. The terms of the Settlement drawn up between my lawyer and the parties, institutions, organizations&#x2014;let&#x2019;s call them the bodies&#x2014;responsible for what happened to me prohibit me from discussing, in any public or recordable format (I know this bit by heart), the nature and/or details of the incident, on pain of forfeiting all financial reparations made to me, plus any surplus these might have accrued (a good word that, &#x201c;accrued&#x201d;) while in my custody&#x2014;and forfeiting quite possibly, my lawyer told me in a solemn voice, a whole lot more besides. Closing the loop, so to speak.<br><br>The Settlement. That word: Settlement. Set-l-ment. As I lay abject, supine, tractioned and trussed up, all sorts of tubes and wires pumping one thing into my body and sucking another out, electronic metronomes and bellows making this speed up and that slow down, their beeping and rasping playing me, running through my useless flesh and organs like sea water through a sponge&#x2014;during the months I spent in hospital, this word planted itself in me and grew. Settlement. It wormed its way into my coma: Greg must have talked about it to me when he came round to gawk at what the accident had left. As the no-space of complete oblivion stretched and contracted itself into gritty shapes and scenes in my unconscious head&#x2014;sports stadiums mainly, running tracks and cricket pitches&#x2014;over which a commentator&#x2019;s voice was playing, inviting me to commentate along with him, the word entered the commentary: we&#x2019;d discuss the Settlement, though neither of us knew what it entailed. Weeks later, after I&#x2019;d emerged from coma, come off the drip-feed and been put onto mushy solids, I&#x2019;d think of the word&#x2019;s middle bit, the -l-, each time I tried to swallow. The Settlement made me gag before it gagged me: that&#x2019;s for sure.<br><br>Later still, during the weeks I sat in bed able to think and talk but not yet to remember anything about myself, the Settlement was held up to me as a future strong enough to counterbalance my no-past, a moment that would make me better, whole, complete. When most of my past had eventually returned, in instalments, like back episodes of some mundane soap opera, but I still couldn&#x2019;t walk, the nurses said the Settlement would put me back on my feet. Marc Daubenay would visit and brief me about our progress towards Settlement while I sat in plaster waiting for my bones to set. After he&#x2019;d left I&#x2019;d sit and think of sets&#x2014;six games in tennis or how- ever many matching cups and plates, the scenery in theatres, patterns. I&#x2019;d think of remote settlements in ancient times, village outposts crouching beneath hostile skies. I&#x2019;d think of people&#x2014;dancers, maybe, or soldiers&#x2014;crouching, set, waiting for some event to start.<br><br>Later, much later, the Settlement came through. I&#x2019;d been out of hospital for four months, out of physiotherapy for one. I was living on my own on the edge of Brixton, in a one-bedroom flat. I wasn&#x2019;t working. The company I&#x2019;d been with up until the accident, a market-research outfit, had said they&#x2019;d give me paid sick leave until May. It was April. I didn&#x2019;t feel like going back to work. I didn&#x2019;t feel like doing anything. I wasn&#x2019;t doing anything. I passed my days in the most routine of activities: getting up and washing, walking to the shops and back again, reading the papers, sitting in my flat. Sometimes I watched TV, but not much; even that seemed too proactive. Occasionally I&#x2019;d take the tube up to Angel, to Marc Daubenay&#x2019;s office. Mostly I just sat in my flat, doing nothing. I was thirty years old.<br><br>On the day the Settlement came through, I did have something to do: I had to go and meet a friend at Heathrow Airport. An old friend. She was flying in from Africa. I was just about to leave my flat when the phone rang. It was Daubenay&#x2019;s secretary. I picked the phone up and her voice said:<br><br>&#x201c;Olanger and Daubenay. Marc Daubenay&#x2019;s office. Putting you through.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Putting you through,&#x201d; she said again.<br><br>I remember feeling dizzy. Things I don&#x2019;t understand make me feel dizzy. I&#x2019;ve learnt to do things slowly since the accident, understanding every move, each part of what I&#x2019;m doing. I didn&#x2019;t choose to do things like this: it&#x2019;s the only way I can do them. If I don&#x2019;t understand words, I have one of my staff look them up. That day back in April when Daubenay&#x2019;s secretary phoned, I didn&#x2019;t have staff, and anyway they wouldn&#x2019;t have helped in that instance. I didn&#x2019;t know who the you was she was putting through&#x2014;Daubenay or me. A trivial distinction, you might say, but the uncertainty still made me dizzy. I placed my hand against my living-room wall.<br><br>Daubenay&#x2019;s voice came on the line after a few seconds:<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; it said.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; I said back.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s come through,&#x201d; said Daubenay.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;That was just your secretary putting us through. Now it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; said Daubenay. His voice was excited; he hadn&#x2019;t taken in what I&#x2019;d just said. &#x201c;Listen: they&#x2019;ve capitulated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Who? Them! The other side. They&#x2019;ve caved in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. I stood there with my hand against the wall. The wall was yellow, I remember.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve approached us,&#x201d; Daubenay continued, &#x201c;with a deal whose terms are very strong each way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are the terms?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;For your part,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;you can&#x2019;t discuss the accident in any public arena or in any recordable format. To all intents and purposes, you must forget it ever happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already forgotten,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I never had any memory of it in the first place.&#x201d;<br><br>This was true, as I mentioned earlier. The last clear memory I have is of being buffeted by wind twenty or so minutes before I was hit.<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t care about that,&#x201d; Daubenay said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what they mean. What they mean is that you must accept that, in law, it ceases to be actionable.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought about that for a while until I understood it. Then I asked him:<br><br>&#x201c;How much are they paying me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eight and a half million,&#x201d; Daubenay said.<br><br>&#x201c;Pounds?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Pounds,&#x201d; Daubenay repeated. &#x201c;Eight and a half million pounds.&#x201d;<br><br>It took another second or so for me to take in just how much money that was. When I had, I took my hand off the wall and turned suddenly around, towards the window. The movement was so forceful that it pulled the phone wire with it, yanked it right out of the wall. The whole connection came out: the wire, the flat-headed bit that you plug in and the casing of the hole that that plugs into too. It even brought some of the internal wiring that runs through the wall out with it, all dotted and flecked with crumbly, fleshy bits of plaster.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>It was no good: the connection had been cut. I stood there for some time, I don&#x2019;t know how long, holding the dead receiver in my hand and looking down at what the wall had spilt. It looked kind of disgusting, like something that&#x2019;s come out of something.<br><br>The horn of a passing car made me snap to. I left my flat and hurried down to a phone box to call Marc Daubenay back. The nearest one was just round the corner, on Coldharbour Lane. As I crossed my road and walked down the one lying perpendicular to it, I thought about the sum: eight and a half million. I pictured it in my mind, its shape. The eight was perfect, neat: a curved figure infinitely turning back into itself. But then the half. Why had they added the half? It seemed to me so messy, this half: a leftover fragment, a shard of detritus. When my knee-cap had set after being shattered in the accident, one tiny splinter had stayed loose. The doctors hadn&#x2019;t managed to fish it out, so it just floated around beside the ball, redundant, surplus to requirements; sometimes it got jammed between the ball and its socket and messed up the whole joint, locking it, inflaming nerves and muscles. I remember picturing the sum&#x2019;s leftover fraction, the half, as I walked down the street that day, picturing it as the splinter in my knee, and frowning, thinking: Eight alone would have been better.<br><br>Other than that, I felt neutral. I&#x2019;d been told the Settlement would put me back together, kick-start my new life, but I didn&#x2019;t feel any different, fundamentally, from when before Marc Daubenay&#x2019;s secretary had phoned. I looked around me at the sky: it was neutral too&#x2014;a neutral spring day, sunny but not bright, neither cold nor warm. I passed my Fiesta, which was parked halfway down the street, and looked at its dented left rear side. Someone had crashed into me in Peckham and then driven off, a month or so before the accident. I&#x2019;d meant to get it fixed, but since coming out of hospital it had seemed irrelevant, like most other things, so the bodywork behind its left rear wheel had stayed dented and crinkled.<br><br>At the end of the road perpendicular to mine I turned right, crossing the street. Beside me was a house that, ten or so months previously, two months before the accident, the police had swooped on with a firearms team. They&#x2019;d been looking for someone and had got a tip-off, I suppose. They&#x2019;d laid siege to this house, cordoning off the road on either side while marksmen stood in bullet-proof vests behind vans and lampposts, pointing rifles at the windows. It was as I passed across the stretch of road they&#x2019;d made into a no man&#x2019;s land for that short while that I realized that I didn&#x2019;t have Marc Daubenay&#x2019;s number on me.<br><br>I stopped right in the middle of the road. There was no traffic. Before heading back towards my flat to get the number I paused for a while, I don&#x2019;t know how long, and stood in what had been the marksmen&#x2019;s sightlines. I turned the palms of my hands outwards, closed my eyes and thought about that memory of just before the accident, being buffeted by wind. Remembering it sent a tingling from the top of my legs to my shoulders and right up into my neck. It lasted for just a moment&#x2014;but while it did I felt not-neutral. I felt different, intense: both intense and serene at the same time. I remember feeling this way very well: standing there, passive, with my palms turned outwards, feeling intense and serene.</p><h2>Usborne Book of Christmas Carols (Songbks.)</h2><p>Book by Amery, Heather</p><p></p><h2>All the Rage: Buddhist Wisdom on Anger and Acceptance</h2><p><b>Leading psychologists and meditation teachers explain how mindfulness can help us work with our anger--and ultimately transform it into compassion.</b><br><br>Anger.

The authors-two seasoned experts of police operations-unearth the hidden truths behind the headline-making stories and explain how cops privately interpret incidents such as the shooting of Amadou Diallo and the Louima torture case. Episodes long forgotten-the campaign against German saboteurs in WWI, or the career of Joe Petrosino, the first Italian American in the ranks, who was gunned down in the streets of Palermo, Sicily-reveal an organization constantly fraught with turmoil, where an outward display of law and order belies the inner conflicts between politicos, bureaucrats, and the men and women on the beat.<br><br>Beyond the inner life of a remarkable institution are the characters and stories, including baffling mysteries, horrific crimes, inspiring heroics, and dreadful scandals. NYPD illuminates the old maxim of the vet to the rookie on his first night on patrol: "Forget everything you learned in the academy, kid."Timely and sure to be controversial, NYPD will be essential reading for anyone interested in law enforcement in America.<br></p><p>Thomas Reppetto is a former Chicago Commander of Detectives and has been the President of New York City's Citizens Crime Commission for twenty years. James Lardner, a writer for The New Yorker and The Atlantic Monthly, has written cover pieces for The New York Times Magazine (including one on the NYPD). He is the author of Fast Forward: Hollywood, the Japanese and the VCR Wars and Crusader: The Hell-Raising Police Career of Detective David Durk.<br>A comprehensive and elegant history of the New York Police Department, this book, written by a journalist (Lardner) and a former cop (Reppetto), charts the department's development, from its origins as a collection of unorganized watchmen in the 1820s to its recent past. In crisp, anecdote-rich prose, Lardner (a New Yorker contributor) and Reppetto (now president of New York's Citizens Crime Commission) take readers on a chronological tourDthrough the years when the department reluctantly adopted firearms and uniforms and when police applicants depended on patronage, through wave after wave of anti-corruption ferment, and through years of controversy. Drawing on sources ranging from the memoir of George Washington Walling, a 19th-century officer who saw action during most of the era's flashpoints (including the 1849 Opera House Riot and the 1863 Draft Riots), to newspaper accounts and legislative committee reports, Lardner and Reppetto assess the potential for good and bad in the city and on its police force. Along the way, they recount colorful stories about early gangs like the Dead Rabbits and Five Pointers; they examine the conflict between the Metropolitan Police and the Municipals, an early rogue offshoot; and they address the department's pendulum-like swings between corruption and reform (which, they note, gets activated every 20 years by a major scandal). They also depict the Giuliani administration's 1990s' "Rediscovery of Crime" and recent controversies like the deaths of Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond, both unarmed black men gunned to death by police officers. Arguing that the cop's lot has barely changed since the 1800s, the two authors assessDin a fair-minded wayDthe enduring relationship between a police force and their city. Their account is at once entertaining, historical and engaged with hard questions about the nature and politics of police workDa true accomplishment. 30 b&amp;w illus. Author tour.

More than five thousand head of unruly cattle were strung out, plodding eastward. The drag riders left no slack, for right on their heels were the two hundred horses intended for the army, as well as the outfit&#x2019;s remuda. Mac, Arch, Hitch and Quickenpaugh kept the horses in line. Directly behind the horse herd came the chuck wagon, Jasmine at the reins. Lorna and Curley rode drag, in the company of Oscar Fentress and Smokey Ellison.<br>&#x201c;I know Mr. Story&#x2019;s been breedin&#x2019; these varmints for nine years,&#x201d; Curley said, &#x201c;but I can&#x2019;t see they&#x2019;re a damn bit smarter than those jugheaded longhorns we brought here from Texas.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think there are some things that can&#x2019;t be bred out of them,&#x201d; said Lorna. &#x201c;Have you ever noticed that when you want a cow or a group of cows to go one certain way, they&#x2019;ll run themselves ragged going some other way?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve noticed that,&#x201d; Curley said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m not near as concerned with the ignorance of the cows as I am the condition of my backside. I&#x2019;d have been spending more time in the saddle, if I&#x2019;d known this drive was coming.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So would I,&#x201d; said Lorna. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I offered to do the cooking. The seat on the wagon box is hard enough, but it won&#x2019;t leave you with saddle sores. Tomorrow will be your turn with the chuck wagon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Curley said. &#x201c;You take it tomorrow, and I&#x2019;ll take it the third day. That&#x2019;s the way Cal set it up. You don&#x2019;t want him thinkin&#x2019; we can&#x2019;t cut the mustard, do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My God, no,&#x201d; said Lorna. &#x201c;I brought three tins of sulfur salve. Until we toughen our hides, we can doctor our saddle sores at night.&#x201d;<br>At that moment, three drag cows wheeled and, evading the drag riders, ran headlong toward the oncoming horse herd. Only the swiftness of Quickenpaugh prevented the horses from stampeding. The Comanche managed to get between the lead horses and the oncoming errant cows. Using his doubled lariat, he swatted the cows on their tender muzzles, and with the help of the drag riders, the troublesome trio again took their places within the herd.<br>&#x201c;Lawd God,&#x201d; said Oscar Fentress, wiping his ebony brow, &#x201c;that be close. Cal think we all be sleeping.&#x201d;<br>But Cal and his companions were having their own problems. Cal rode point, while Bill Petty, Tom Allen, Quanah Taylor and Bud McDaniels were the flank riders. Much of the longhorn temperament had been bred out of the cows, but they seemed to have retained all or most of the cussedness of their longhorn ancestors. Sundown only minutes away, they gave it up, bedding down the herd for the night. The wind, out of the northwest, had a frosty bite to it.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinkin&#x2019; we should have delayed this drive at least until April first,&#x201d; Tom Allen said. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m any judge, there&#x2019;s more snow on the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody objected when I set the starting day,&#x201d; said Cal with some irritation.<br>&#x201c;Like it or not,&#x201d; Bill Petty said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re neck-deep in a trail drive. Whatever happens, I reckon we&#x2019;ll have to make the best of it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There be water,&#x201d; said Oscar. &#x201c;Was there shelter, this wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If we had ham, we could have ham and eggs, if we had some eggs,&#x201d; Smokey Ellison said. &#x201c;We better get these varmints on the trail at daylight, and start lookin&#x2019; for an arroyo deep enough to keep the snow off of us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The tents Mr. Story insisted we bring may be a great help,&#x201d; said Lorna.<br>Supper was a mostly silent affair, each of them aware that if fate was unkind to them, they might be plagued by snow until April and beyond.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go with two watches,&#x201d; said Cal. &#x201c;The first to midnight, and the second until first light. Arch, Hitch, Mac and Quickenpaugh, I want you on the first watch.

Curley, you and Jasmine take the first watch with Arch, Hitch, Mac and Quickenpaugh. Lorna, you&#x2019;ll take the second watch with me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t sure I want my woman standin&#x2019; watch with a bunch of hombres,&#x201d; Bud said.<br>&#x201c;Bud,&#x201d; said Curley, &#x201c;these are the same hombres that came up the trail from Texas with us near ten years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right, Bud,&#x201d; Jasmine said. &#x201c;Now shut up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When this herd&#x2019;s sold,&#x201d; said Bud, &#x201c;I might just take my share and ride back to Texas, or at least far enough so&#x2019;s my big sister can&#x2019;t tell me to shut up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You do,&#x201d; Curley said, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;ll go by yourself. It&#x2019;s not home to me anymore.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The order stands, then.&#x201d; said Cal. &#x201c;Jasmine and Curley, you&#x2019;ll take the first watch, and Lorna, you&#x2019;ll be part of the second.&#x201d;<br>The three women worked together getting the supper ready and cleaning up afterward. When it was time for the first watch to begin circling the herd, Jasmine and Curley saddled their horses. Bud McDaniels said nothing.<br>Jasmine and Curley rode out together, and when they were far enough away, Curley had something to say.<br>&#x201c;Bud and his damn pride. He&#x2019;ll never outgrow it, will he?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Jasmine. &#x201c;I have my doubts. But the last thing Cal needs on this drive is females that need or expect to be coddled.&#x201d;<br>Curley laughed. &#x201c;If anybody has a right to whine, it&#x2019;s me. I have saddle sores as big as silver dollars on my behind, and here I am in the saddle for seven more hours.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you didn&#x2019;t say anything around Bud,&#x201d; Jasmine said. &#x201c;Once this watch is done, I&#x2019;ll get some of Lorna&#x2019;s sulfur salve and ease your pain. You may have to do the same for me.&#x201d;<br>SOUTH-CENTRAL WYOMING TERRITORY.<br>MARCH 3, 1876<br>With Benton McCaleb as trail boss, the Lone Star herd moved north, along the Powder River. Brazos Gifford, Will Elliot, Monte Nance and Pen Rhodes were the flankers, while Jed and Stoney Vandiver&#x2014;assisted by Penelope and Rebecca&#x2014;rode drag. Goose, the Lipan Apache, was far ahead of the herd, scouting for possible Indian sign. It was Rosalie&#x2019;s turn on the high box of the chuck wagon, and it trailed along behind the drag riders. The herd had been bedded down along the Powder when Goose rode in. McCaleb and his riders all gathered around to hear what the Indian had to report.<br>&#x201c;No sign,&#x201d; said Goose. &#x201c;Snow come.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I been sayin&#x2019; all day,&#x201d; Monte Nance said.<br>&#x201c;We know,&#x201d; said Brazos wearily. &#x201c;We know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a risk we had to take,&#x201d; McCaleb said. &#x201c;We have no choice, unless we turn back to our home range. Does anybody favor that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hell, no,&#x201d; said Will Elliot. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re Texans, and we don&#x2019;t start anything we can&#x2019;t finish.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I favor goin&#x2019; back,&#x201d; Monte Nance said. &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t more than thirty miles out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Little brother,&#x201d; said Rebecca angrily, &#x201c;if you don&#x2019;t have the sand for this drive, saddle up and head for home. The rest of us are going to Deadwood.&#x201d;<br>There were shouts of agreement from the rest of the outfit. Monte Nance curbed his angry response, bit his tongue and said nothing. Before it was time for the start of the first watch, the wind turned colder and changed direction, coming out of the northwest.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be blowin&#x2019; like hell wouldn&#x2019;t have it by morning,&#x201d; Brazos predicted.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; said McCaleb. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t have time to find shelter any better than we have right here, which is practically none. The best we can do is break out all the extra canvas and set up some windbreaks while it&#x2019;s still light enough to see.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be needin&#x2019; firewood, and lots of it,&#x201d; said Brazos. &#x201c;Suppose I take Jed, Stoney and Will, and drag in some wood, while the rest of you put up the windbreaks?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do that,&#x201d; McCaleb said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gettin&#x2019; colder by the minute, and we&#x2019;ll be needing a fire tonight.&#x201d;<br>Instead of taking turns cooking, Rebecca, Rosalie and Susannah joined forces each day, making the cooking and the cleanup far easier than it might have been. Not to be outdone, Penelope had taken to helping them. Monte Nance eyed Penelope, and while she paid him no attention, Rosalie watched him warily. Monte was more than ten years older than Penelope, and while she showed no interest in him, Rosalie knew just how unpredictable her daughter was. Not until the first watch did she have a chance to talk to Brazos. The snow had not begun, and Brazos dismounted.<br>&#x201c;This is the only time I can talk to you without the others hearing,&#x201d; said Rosalie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about Penelope. Monte&#x2019;s looking at her all the time, and I have a good idea as to what&#x2019;s on his mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Penelope&#x2019;s just as beautiful as her mama,&#x201d; Brazos said, &#x201c;and there&#x2019;s no law against a man looking. I doubt she&#x2019;s ever spoken a word to him. He&#x2019;s Rebecca&#x2019;s brother. ...</p></p><h2>Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality</h2><p>An unprecedented work from the brilliant young editor of The New Republic--who is celebrated also as an incisive defender of the equality of homosexuals--Virtually Normal is an impassioned, reasoned, subtle, and uncompromising political and moral treatise that will set the terms of the homosexuality debate for the foreseeable future.</p><p>In a dizzyingly short period of time, homosexuality has gone from being the love that dare not speak its name to the one that shouts it. Refreshingly, in this wide-ranging discussion of the moral and political status of homosexuals, Sullivan, the gay former whizbang <i>New Republic</i> editor, prefers the middle register. On the one hand, he shuns the liberal tendency to give gays victim status but, on the other, advocates the legalization of gay marriage because he views it as the public recognition of a gay's basic human right to fully love another member of his/her group -- a right that, Sullivan notes, even bigots generally grant those they hate."Virtually Normal is a brilliant and revolutionary book that will transform gay studies." --Camille Paglia, Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Groundbreaking. . . . Virtually Normal arrives at an opportune historical moment. . . .

Since he began to read, "besotted by salt-water dreams and nautical language," he studied the lore surrounding a place of mythic proportions: the ever-alluring Cape Horn. And after years of dreaming--and sailing--he finally made his voyage there. In this lively, thrilling blend of history, geography, and modern-day adventure, Murphy shows how the myth crossed wakes with his reality.Cape Horn is a buttressed pyramid of crumbly rock situated at the very bottom of South America--55 degrees 59 minutes South by 67 degrees 16 minutes West. It's a place of forlorn and foreboding beauty, one that has captured the dark imaginations of explorers and writers from Francis Drake to Joseph Conrad. For centuries, the small stretch of water between Cape Horn and the Antarctic peninsula was the only gateway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and it's a place where the storms are bigger, the winds stronger, the seas rougher than anywhere else on earth. <i>Rounding the Horn</i> is the ultimate maritime rite of passage, and in Murphy's hands, it becomes a thrilling, exuberant tour. Weaving together stories of his own nautical adventures with long-lost tales of those who braved the Cape before him--from Spanish missionaries to Captain Cook--and interspersed with breathtaking descriptions of the surrounding wilderness, the result is a beautifully crafted, immensely enjoyable read.</p><p><b>Dallas Murphy</b> is a novelist, playwright, and marine journalist. His plays have been produced Off Broadway, and his series of three novels featuring the reluctant sleuth Artie Deemer have been critically acclaimed. His most recent book, an account of Cape Horn, <i>Rounding the Horn</i> , was published in 2004 by Basic Books. He lives in New York City.Even landlubbers may recognize Cape Horn as the Americas' southernmost tip. Between this crag of rock and Antarctica lies the Drake Passage, whose waters are the planet's most consistently violent. Of a trip through these latitudes, sailors warned, "Below 40 South there is no law, below 50 South there is no God." Murphy, a mystery writer and nautical journalist, sailed there from Ushuaia, Argentina, in a 53-foot sloop and carefully points out that he only visited the island rather than sailing around it. He revels in the tales of those who made the entire trip, however, and spends much time vividly recounting their adventures, found in old books with thrilling titles like <i>The World Encompassed</i> and <i>A Two Years' Cruise off Tierra Del Fuego</i>. Nautical buffs will find some of these yarns familiar: Darwin's South American voyages aboard HMS <i>Beagle</i> were the subject of last fall's <i>Evolution's Captain</i>, by Peter Nichols, and Murphy's version adds little to the story beyond subtle interpretive differences. Another chapter touches upon the U.S. Navy's South Seas Exploring Expedition, chronicled at length by Nathaniel Philbrick in <i>Sea of Glory</i> (also published last fall). Yet such narrative retreads are offset by the details of Murphy's own voyage (his desire to explore almost set off an international incident with the Chilean government). As exciting as Murphy's historical yarns are, it's always a treat to return to him and his crew as they brave the elements at the end of the earth.

In late 19th century London, a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy. In the course of their investigations, the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers. The stories, which all deal with imposture of some kind, are only tangentially related to each other, yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand. Machen builds suspense slowly and methodically, masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected, gruesome climax. Comical, tragic, sophisticated, violent, horrific, and even downright disgusting, THE THREE IMPOSTORS is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit. -- cameron-vale, Amazon reviews</p><p></p><h2>A Concordance to the Septuagint and the Other Greek Versions of the Old Testament, Including the Apocryphal Books</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century</h2><p><p>Based on research in the Inquisitorial archives, the book recounts the story of a peasant fertility cult centred on the benandanti. These men and women regarded themselves as professional anti-witches, who (in dream-like states) apparently fought ritual battles against witches and wizards, to protect their villages and harvests. If they won, the harvest would be good, if they lost, there would be famine. The inquisitors tried to fit them into their pre-existing images of the witchesï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122; sabbat. The result of this cultural clash which lasted over a century, was the slow metamorphosis of the benandanti into their enemies ï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201c; the witches. Carlo Ginzburg shows clearly how this transformation of the popular notion of witchcraft was manipulated by the Inquisitors, and disseminated all over Europe and even to the New World. The peasantsï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122; fragmented and confused testimony reaches us with great immediacy, enabling us to identify a level of popular belief which constitutes a valuable witness for the reconstruction of the peasant way of thinking of this age. </p></p><p><p>Carlo Ginzburg's The Night Battles is a remarkable tale of witchcraft, folk culture, and persuasion in early modern Europe.</p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>The True Princess</h2><p>This book is a classic that will teach children what makes a true princess in Jesus&#x2019; eyes!

Here is a photographer who travels the world, tirelessly seeking to capture its idols in quiet moments and catch a trace of their essential being behind all the fame and glamour.<br>Taken primarily in black and white with a hand-held camera and without auxiliary lighting, most of Corbijn's photographs are shot in those quiet moments between performances. Beyond the reach of the glaring spotlights, on the dark side of the star cult - literally and metaphorically - Corbijn finds what interests him more than gesture, image or glamour: the unusual degree of privacy and closeness that turns his portraits into genuine character studies.<br>Corbijn has now moved beyond the boundaries of music photography and Star Trak reads like a visual encyclopedia of the icons of our culture, gathering together outstanding personalities from the worlds of film, literature, rock music and fashion. He visits film directors Wim Wenders, David Lynch, and Martin Scorsese, actors Johnny Depp, Gerard Depardieu and Jodie Foster, and alongside the older rebels - like Mick Jagger and Leonard Cohen - he includes the enfants terribles of the Eighties and Nineties - Kurt Cobain, Billy Idol, and Slash. Corbijn couples the excesses of William S. Burroughs with the beauty of supermodels Naomi and Christy, and brings Salman Rushdie and Bono together in front of the camera.</p><p>Anton Corbijn has &#34;a reluctance to impose&#34; on his subjects that they admire, &#34;a way of making you feel that you wouldn&#39;t mind experimentally making an arse of yourself--because he doesn&#39;t either,&#34; says Brian Eno, whose eerie portrait is one of the more arresting images in this collection of Corbijn&#39;s work. There are some powerful photographs here--Sinead O&#39;Connor, David Byrne, William S. Burroughs--that stand as testament to the portraitist&#39;s talents. His use of color is beautifully surreal, but most of his pictures are black and white. Some are decidedly unflattering: Johnny Cash looks like a cadaver, Neil Young like an ex-con who could use a kind word. Some are playful, such as those of Mick Jagger cavorting in a pair of masks. The majority of Corbijn&#39;s photographs are raw and unsettling; few are possible to ignore.* Crisp and dynamic portraits which reveal the Corbijn signature style <p>* Includes portraits of Billy Idol, Leonard Cohen, Clint Eastwood, and Salman Rushdie </p><p>* Related backlist: Anton Corbijn 33 Still Lives (3-8238-5448-8, teNeues) and Anton Corbijn Werk (3-888-14927-4, Schirmer/Mosel distributed by teNeues)</p></p><h2>Highly Favored of the Lord II</h2><p>Mike Stroud has become a favorite teacher to many &#x201c;seekers of truth&#x201d; around the globe.

Crossing economic, social, and geographic boundaries, these sisters support each other emotionally, financially, and physically. <br> The stories they tell are uplifting, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking. From singer Mary J. Blige and her sister LaTonya, who moved her entire family into Mary's mansion to manage her career, to Andrea and Lorelei Williams, who grew up in a one-room studio in Harlem and often didn't have food or electricity, to Bethann Hardison and her friend Marta Vargas, who share the bond of sisterhood as friends, <b>Sisterfriends</b> mines the whole experience in the words of its women.

Wohlmuth. Included are the famous and not so famous, the young and old, blood sisters, sorority sisters, and sisterlike friends. Women from many backgrounds that cross physical distance, time, and economic and social lines share their unique stories of friendship and sisterhood and how they have established and maintained relationships with other woman. These women acknowledge that their friendships have enhanced their lives and helped to shape the individuals that they have become. Agins' and Chance's collaboration underscores the sentiment that sisterhood is a union defying definition--more than simple bloodlines but rather a closeness that is actively sought and willingly shared. <i>Lillian Lewis</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The continued relevance of the issues with which this book deals justifies its reappearance twelve years after its first advent challenged countless people to rethink their Evangelical heritage. If anything, the challenge is even greater now to follow the example set by the forebears of twentieth century evangelicalism.For instance, Catherine Booth, co-founder of the Salvation Army and ardent feminist, offers a powerful testimony to the impact that Christian witness can and should have upon society. Likewise, abolitionist Theodore Weld, converted under the ministry of Charles G. Finney, showed what a response to the radical call of Christ means as he strove to right social injustice and inequity during his day.Despite the hardship and consequences of living out their faith, these and other evangelical forerunners left a heritage to be remembered and an example to be followed. Like the author himself, the reader will be challenged to rethink his or her own relationship with Evangelicalism and will have to reflect upon the broader significance of that movement in American culture.</p><p>Donald W.

By the Newbery Honor author of The Great Fire.</p><p>Grade 5-8-James, a 16-year-old private serving in G Company of the 122nd Regiment, New York Volunteers, is baffled when his lieutenant assigns him to be the company historian in his Union regiment. He is initially at a loss as to what he is supposed to record, but gradually becomes more at ease with his responsibility and even finds solace in the task. James's account captures the tedium and drudgery of day-to-day life in the infantry, the confusion and terror of battle, and the horrors of medical practices of the period. Murphy bases this "journal" on real diaries of actual Civil War soldiers. He attempts to lend authenticity to the farm boy's writing by using expressions such as, "We was" or "the shadows was"; other times, he writes in literate and affective prose. For example, "The damage to the enemy lines was severe and their screams terrible." If anything, the author includes too many details and keeps readers from connecting with the protagonist's thoughts and fears. The story gets more exciting when James is lost behind enemy lines and is hidden from Confederate soldiers by a slave woman. The action is neatly wrapped up and the epilogue is a bit too tidy. Nonetheless, this is a solid addition to a popular series.<br><i>Ann M.

Born in Milan, Vitale is a former chairwoman for the American Italian Cancer Foundation and devotes much of her time to raising money for cancer research. She currently lives in Palm Beach, Florida. <br>Course by course, region by region, and food by food, the nuances of Italian cuisine have gradually been revealed to the American palate. We've become acquainted with pasta, polenta and now, in this volume by Vitale and Lawley, with rice. While many recipes here are indeed excellent--from rice soup with leeks to bittersweet rice salad, melon and prosciutto risotto, and rice in dark butter to a rice cake with Grand Marnier--to call these "undiscovered" is chancey, considering the not-so-new discovery of Italian risotto by Americans and the plethora of cookbooks recently published about Italy's culinary breadbasket: the fertile north. At the volume's outset, the authors lend some valuable advice about ingredients and tools. However, their commentary about the dishes is unfortunately slim and their comments about wines are inconsistent: while "The hearty flavors of this risotto call for a robust wine; you might try a Barbera from the Piedmont region" is helpful counsel, "A good bottle of Carema will enhance your Risotto alla Milanese" doesn't give sufficient information. Moreover, ingredients available in Italy and America do vary, and a book for the American market should reflect the differences. The black olives called for in a recipe for rice salad with onions, black olives and fresh tomatoes are most likely not the common--and flavorless--canned, California Mission olives found on supermarket shelves. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Quilts and Me: The Diary of an American Quilter</h2><p>Folk artist shares her quilts in this illustrated book.</p><p>Nora McKeown Ezell was named a 1992 National Heritage Fellow in the National Endowment for the Arts program that recognizes individuals who carry on folk traditions in the United States.

The two Babylons seeks to demonstrate a connection between the ancient Babylonian mystery religions and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Often controversial, yet always engaging, The Two Babylons comes from an era when disciplines such as archaeology and anthropology were in their infancy, and represents an early attempt to synthesize many of the findings of these areas and Biblical truth. The author methodically uses the ancient Chaldean Language and an abundance of Greek, Roman, Egyptian and other authors. Catholicism is just disguised Egyptian and Greek mystery religions by those that were in a dying Roman Empire trying to hold onto power in any way possible. So they created the facade at the Nicene Council in 327 AD called Catholicism. ABOUT THE AUTHOR:- Alexander Hislop (1807-1865) was a Free Church of Scotland minister known for his criticisms of the Roman Catholic Church. He was for a time Parish schoolmaster of Wick, Caithness. In 1831 he married Jane Pearson. He was for a time editor of the Scottish Guardian newspaper. As a probationer he joined the Free Church of Scotland at the disruption 1843. He was ordained in 1844 at the East Free Church, Arbroath, where he became senior minister in 1864. He died of a paralytic stroke, the next year after being ill for about two years.

Here is the untold story evidence that God&#39;s People visited distant lands in Europe and America in ancient times. The central theme of this book is the biblical Covenant which God made with the Patriarchs and their descendants. This included the biblical promise of numerous descendants who would build powerful wealthy nations. This exciting story is told with the aid of over 100 maps charts and illustrations. The book begins with the call of Abraham and the elements of the unconditional Covenant which God made with the Patriarchs and their descendants. Strong evidence is presented that the real Mt. Horeb on which Moses and the Israelites received the Torah and made a covenant with God is not in Egypt&#39;s Sinai desert but rather in another location identified both in the Bible and by physical evidence existing to this day. The role of the Israelite tribes in the ancient Sea Peoples is shown to parallel accounts about them in the book of Judges. This book then reveals new information about King David the warrior king who united the tribes of Israel made lasting ties with Tyre and Sidon and built an Israelite Empire. This book documents that the Israelites were not only major players in ancient history but actually became the leading powers on earth under Kings David and Solomon. When it is realized that the Israelite tribes had major roles in that time it becomes easier for the reader to understand that the ten tribes have also had major roles in the world&#39;s geopolitics from that time forward. Paperback</p><p></p><h2>The Presidency of James Buchanan (American Presidency Series)</h2><p>This book offers conclusions that are very different from most of the traditional historical interpretations of the Buchanan presidency. Historians have either condemned Buchanan for weakness and vacillation or portrayed him as a president dedicated to peace who did everything constitutionally possible to avoid war. Under the scrutiny of Elbert B. Smith, Buchanan emerges as a strong figure who made vital contributions not to peace but to the accelerating animosities that produced the war.<br><br>"Historians who have considered the Civil War a necessary and justifiable price for the destruction of slavery should feel a debt to James Buchanan," Smith writes. "Those who think the war could and should have been avoided owe him nothing."<br><br>Most of the accounts of the era have concentrated on the Dred Scott Case, Bleeding Kansas and the Lecompton Constitution, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown, the rise of the Republicans and the disintegration of the Democrats, the election of 1860, and the bitter quarrels over slavery extension occasioned by these events. Buchanan has often appeared on a stage occupied by more important actors.<br><br>Whether or not the war was already inevitable by March, 1857, cannot be proved. That a subsequent series of emotion-packed events filled both North and South with rage and fear, triggering secession and the war, is undebatable. It is Smith's theory that Buchanan, in leading the United States through these fateful years, added much to the war spirit that developed in both sections. Driven by affection and sympathy for the Southerners, he tried to satisfy their demands for slavery rights in the territories. This aroused bitter anti-South feelings throughout the North, which foiled his efforts and further convinced the Southerners that they could no longer have their way inside the Union. The one event that finally triggered the Southern secession was the election of a Republican president, and Buchanan's agreement with the Southern demands and his personal hatred for Stephen A. Douglas did much to accomplish this.<br><br>Covering the most controversial period in American history, Smith presents important new evaluations for the consideration of students of both the Civil War and the presidency.</p><p>Elbert B. Smith is professor of history at the University of Maryland. His other books include <i>The Presidencies of Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore, The Death of Slavery</i>, and <i>Magnificent Missourian: The Life of Thomas Hart Benton</i>."An engaging, highly readable account of the conditions, events, and personalities of the years preceding the Civil War and a critical, personal view of Buchanan&#x2019;s leadership."&#x2014;<b><i>History: Reviews of New Books</i></b><p>"Understanding Buchanan, his presidency, and the coming of the Civil War is no small task. To this enterprise Smith brings crisp prose, effective organization, and a sense of the provocative."&#x2014;<b><i>Journal of Southern History</i></b></p><p>"Smith moves President Buchanan closer to center stage as the drama of the immediate pre-Civil War period unfolds.

Winner of the PEN West Award for the Novel. A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.</b></p> <p>"Reading <i>Tomato Red</i>&#x2014;the first Daniel Woodrell novel I came upon&#x2014;was a transformative experience. It expanded my sense of the possibilities not only of crime fiction, but of fiction itself&#x2014;of language, of storytelling. Time and again, his work just dazzles and humbles me. God bless Busted Flush for these glorious reissues. It's a service to readers everywhere, and a great gift."&#x2014;Megan Abbott, award-winning author of <i>Bury Me Deep</i></p> <p>"Woodrell's storytelling is as melodic, jangly, and energetic as a good banjo riff. . . . If one is tempted to hear the echoes of William Faulkner, or Erskine Caldwell . . . no matter. Mr. Woodrell isn't imitating any of them. He's only drawing from the same well they did, but with a different take, a different voice, a sharper sense of irony."&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p> <p>A dark noir novel set in West Table, Missouri, featuring nineteen-year-old Jamalee, her gorgeous gay brother, Jason, and Sammy Barlach, the young man passing through West Table, who just may be their ticket out.</p> <p><b>Daniel Woodrell</b> lives in the Missouri Ozarks. His five most recent novels were selected as <i>New York Times</i> Notable Books of the Year, and <i>Tomato Red</i> won the PEN West Award for the Novel. His short story "Uncle" (in Busted Flush Press' <i>A Hell of a Woman: An Anthology of Female Noir</i>) was nominated for the Edgar Award.</p><br></p><p>The hero of Daniel Woodrell's <i>Tomato Red</i> is the most endearingly out-of-control loser you're likely to meet. Sammy Barlach looks like a person "who should in any circumstances be considered a suspect"; clerks follow him through the supermarket when he shops, and the police pull him over simply from habit. But in spite of his looks, Sammy only wants to be loved, even if it's just by "the bunch that would have me"--and in the hardscrabble world of West Table, Missouri, that's a bunch you wouldn't necessarily want to meet. The novel begins with a heady Methedrine rush, as Sammy celebrates payday by letting himself be talked into robbing a nearby mansion. Even when his newfound friends disappear as he's breaking in, he persists: "You might think I should've quit on the burglary right there, but I just love people, I guess, and didn't." The break-in leads Sammy into an unlikely alliance with the Merridew family: Jamalee and Jason and their mother Bev, a prostitute in the town's ironically named Venus Holler. Flame-haired Jamalee dreams constantly of a different kind of life, and she plans on using Jason's extraordinary beauty as her ticket out of West Table. Jason, however, seems to be shaping up as what Sammy calls "country queer"--which, as Sammy observes, "ain't the easiest walk to take amongst your throng of fellow humankind."<p> Unfortunately for Jamalee, Woodrell's Ozarks is a place that rewards ambition with disaster. Here as in his five previous "country <i>noir</i>" novels, Woodrell writes with a keen understanding of class and a barely contained sense of rage. The residents of West Table's trailer parks and shotgun shacks share Sammy's sense of limited possibilities. "<i>I ain't shit! I ain't shit!</i> shouts your brain," Sammy thinks while wandering around the mansion, "and this place proves the point." Even when Jason sticks up for his own family, the way he does so is heartbreaking: "This expression of utter frankness takes over Jason's beautiful face, and he says, 'I don't think we're the <i>lowest</i> scum in town.' He didn't argue that we weren't scum, just disputed our position on the depth chart." With her mildewing etiquette guides and grandiose plans, Jamalee is the only character who doesn't share their sense of defeat, and she's the only one who, in the end, gets away--though she leaves behind her a trail of betrayal and heartache. By the time the novel's final tragedy rolls around, it seems both senseless and inevitable, as tragedies do in real life. Told in a voice that crackles with energy and wit, <i>Tomato Red</i> is sharp, funny, and more importantly, true. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Daniel Woodrell lives in the Missouri Ozarks near the Arkansas line.

Burroughs countervails such incorrectness, however, with some rather unattractive representations of white civilization--mutinous, murderous sailors, effete aristos, self-involved academics, and hard-hearted cowards. At Tarzan's heart rightly lies the resourceful and hunky title character, a man increasingly torn between the civil and the savage, for whom cutlery will never be less than a nightmare. <p> The passages in which the nut-brown boy teaches himself to read and write are masterly and among the book's improbable, imaginative best. How tempting it is to adopt the ten-year-old's term for letters--"little bugs"! And the older Tarzan's realization that civilized "men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle," while not exactly a new notion, is nonetheless potent. The first in Burroughs's serial is most enjoyable in its resounding oddities of word and thought, including the unforgettable "When Tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled; and smiles are the foundation of beauty."</p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Christmas with Martha Stewart Living Holiday Celebrations (7)</h2><p>recipes for the holiday</p><p></p><h2>Hikaru no Go, Vol. 6 (6)</h2><p>Hikaru Shindo is like any sixth-grader in Japan: a pretty normal school boy with a two-tone head of hair and a penchant for antics.

Like anything coming from Marcella Althaus-Reid and Lisa Isherwood, it is controversial and challenging as well as highly original. The book will: make visible a range of trans lived experience [transgendered and transsexual], offer theological reflection on these experiences, create challenging theology from this experiential base, and provide a resource for churches and theology students not to date available. It includes an excellent range of contributors, including Elizabeth Stuart and Virginia Ramey Mollenkott. This is a valuable addition to reading lists of courses on religion, gender and the body.</p><p>Marcella Althaus-Reid was Professor of Contextual Theology at the University of Edinburgh. Lisa Isherwood is Professor of Feminist Liberation Theologies at the University of Winchester.</p><h2>Discipleship Handbook</h2><p>There is no higher calling than to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. Nothing compares to knowing and following the Savior of the world. To know Him is to love Him, and to follow Him is a wonderful adventure. Still, the discipleship journey is full of pitfalls and snares that threaten to lead us away from the narrow path that leads to heaven. If the devil had his way, every Christian would be lulled to spiritual slumber or led into forbidï¿½den paths that would steal the heart away from God. Therefore, even after we are baptized, it is imperative that we continue to grow into active and mature disciples of Christ. The Discipleship Handbook will benefit anyone seeking such an experience with Jesus. It may be used for personal study or in Sabbath schools, prayer meetings, small groups, or one-on-one settings. It is more than a book about discipleship. Rather, it contains everything needed for a six-month, Bible-based discipleship plan for Seventh-day Adventist churches and their members. The Discipleship Handbook was developed to ensure that the most essential areas of discipleship are covered. The devotional life, personal witnessing, church life, Christian lifestyle, and evangelism each receive special emphasis. For newer members, the 26 chapters of the Discipleship Handbook serve as the heart of 26 weekly meetings with a more experienced mentor.</p><p></p><h2>Skeleton Crew: Stories</h2><p><b>Features &#x201c;The Mist&#x201d; now a TV series event on Spike</b><br> <br>Stephen King&#x2019;s #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller&#x2014;an anthology of stories from the outer limits of the imagination!<br><br>From one of the greatest storytellers in modern times comes this classic collection of twenty-two works of fright and wonder...unforgettable tales that will take you to where your darkest fears await. Whether it&#x2019;s a mysterious impenetrable mist camouflaging bizarre, otherworldly terrors that could herald the destruction of humanity...or an eerie-looking child&#x2019;s toy that harbors an unimaginable evil...or four college students on a deserted lake encountering something that crosses the boundary of sanity...or a man suddenly given the omnipotent ability to quite literally edit his own reality...the extraordinary narratives found in <i>Skeleton Crew </i>are the enduring and irresistible proof that Stephen King is a true master of the short fiction form.</p><p>In the introduction to <i>Skeleton Crew</i> (1985), his second collection of stories, King pokes fun at his penchant for "literary elephantiasis," makes scatological jokes about his muse, confesses how much money he makes (gross and net), and tells a story about getting arrested one time when he was "suffused with the sort of towering, righteous rage that only drunk undergraduates can feel." He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: "Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way."<p> And he sure does. <i>Skeleton Crew</i> contains a superb short novel ("The Mist") that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. </p><p> In addition to "The Mist," the real standout is "The Reach," a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across "the Reach," the body of water between island and mainland. This is the story that King fans give to their friends who don't read horror in order to show them how literate, how charming a storyteller he can be. Don't miss it. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

As a biography of the designer, Pochna&#39;s book is complete and telling, perhaps not swept up high enough in the airy realms of fashion to please devoted couture mavens but highly informative and interesting for general readers interested in Dior and his impact on the fashion industry. The business of fashion rather than the artistry of Dior&#39;s designs is where Pochna directs much of her attention. After all, the marketing and branding that Dior helped initiate was innovative, so discussions of licensing agreements and the development of designer accessories, along with Dior&#39;s youthful development and inspirations, blend into a provocative profile of this fashion great.<p><strong>Marie-France Pochna </strong>is a biographer and ghost writer specializing in the worlds of industrialists as well as high fashion.

A Peace Corps worker finishing up a monastic two-year stint in Tanzania, he teaches villagers how to build fish ponds. He is a long way from his previous life in Memphis, Tennessee - a life of legal briefs and expositions, sweaty infidelities, and a wrecked engagement. In the lush Usambara Mountains, Jordan hopes to start over. Despite his labors, the sins of his past revisit him in the form of a beautiful young school girl named Zanifa. Promised to a wealthy, Oxford-educated African prince, she awaits her marriage and forced ritual mutilation with a mixture of hope and resignation. But Jordan becomes outraged, refusing to accept the girl&#39;s fate. And as his initial attraction to Zanifa grows into an obsession, he decides her only salvation lies in her seduction... Now the cycle of passion and vengeance is set in motion and the prince will demand his own cruel revenge. In a desperate and determined final gesture of love, Jordan takes a risk at once noble, foolhardy, and terrifying. And in a shocking conclusion, the price of love and justice will be levied and paid.A thirtyish American goes to Africa to find redemption but comes across instead as a self-centered and culturally insensitive mischief-maker. Newcomer Coleman, an American who attended the University of Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania, vividly evokes the East African countryside, and his descriptions of village life and local politics are deft and to the point. But the heart of his story--a Memphis attorney's attempts to salvage a misspent life by serving in the Peace Corps--is fundamentally flawed. Rutledge Jordan had cheated so often on Anna, his longtime love, that she finally left him for good. Now, heartbroken and disenchanted with his law practice, Rutledge is in Africa trying to save himself while teaching the local tribespeople how to build fish farms and while also observing the habitat of endangered eagles. To help preserve the species, he removes an eaglet from its nest and brings it home to rear and later release into the wild. A 16-year-old local girl, Zanifa, bright as well as beautiful, assists him in feeding and training the bird. Rutledge is attracted to her, of course, and when he learns she's to be married to Kimweri--a local Oxford-educated potentate who insists that she first undergo female circumcision--Rutledge initiates her sexually. Given the place, his age, and her impoverished circumstances, however, the suggestion of opportunism rather than heroism is unavoidable for the reader. Obsessed, Rutledge abducts Zanifa from Kimweri's domain just before the marriage is to take place; then he flees with her (after his eagle brutally wounds Kimweri) to Kenya, where he enrolls her in a school paid for with money he's earned smuggling dope and gems. Kimweri is powerful and will exact a brutal revenge--but it doesn't matter: According to his lights but unfortunately not the reader's, Rutledge has become a changed (and better) version of himself. An unintentionally distasteful tale of an ugly American. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Each of the more than 250 biographies contains the architect&#x2019;s era of work, educational and professional experience, and a description of his or her most notable buildings. Many of the architects included in this book are relatively obscure or unknown, while others are considered stars of the profession, such as Cass Gilbert, Clarence Johnston, &#x201c;Cap&#x201d; Turner, and Edwin Lundie. Noted Minnesota architectural historian Alan K.

"Yes, a real, live duchess, not a real, dead duchess." </p><p> "Oh, you know what I mean." Mary threw herself on the bed with her sister's worn portmanteau, three ball gowns, a stack of freshly folded unmentionables, and a pair of well-worn ball slippers. "I wish I could go to a real, live duchess's house for a three-week house party!" </p><p> Caitlyn placed a pair of only-mended-once stockings into a small trunk on the floor. "Surely you're not begrudging me the only fun I've had in months?" </p><p> "No, I just wish I might go <i>with</i> you." Mary threw her arms out to the side. "The letter from the duchess said there will be walks through the park, horseback rides, archery, card games -- " </p><p> "Mother was not happy about that aspect." </p><p> "No, but Papa slipped you a guinea that you might play, so it can't be <i>too</i> bad. Besides, it wasn't the gaming that had Mother in a taking; it was the masquerade ball. I truly thought she'd refuse to allow you to go when the duchess wrote that you'd need a costume." </p><p> "I had to promise not to wear a mask and to behave as any gently raised young lady should." </p><p> Mary's brow rose. "Can you do that?" </p><p> "I <i>will</i> do it," Caitlyn said fervently, and meant it. She always did; the trouble was remembering she wished to behave herself when she lost her temper. She didn't have a burning desire to thwart society's rules; but when she was challenged or angry, her competitive spirit burned through all caution or thought. </p><p> Caitlyn stuffed a shawl into the portmanteau with more force than necessary. Blast it, if only she'd kept her temper three months ago and hadn't allowed Alexander MacLean to irk her into saying and doing things she shouldn't have. But there wasn't anything she could do about it now -- except use this incredibly fortuitous invitation to reestablish herself and her family into society's good graces. </p><p> Mary reached out to touch one of the new gowns spread upon the bed, ready to be wrapped in tissue paper before being packed. "Certainly no one at the duchess's house will have as beautiful gowns as these. You sew better than most of the modistes on Bond Street." </p><p> Caitlin smiled. "Thank you! That's quite a compliment. I'm very proud of the silver one; it's for the masquerade." </p><p> "It looks wonderful on you, even though Mother made you sew the neckline so high." Mary grimaced. "If she had her way, you'd go to the masquerade sewn chin to toes into a large burlap potato sack. Mother worries far too much, even though you -- " Mary's face pinkened. </p><p> Caitlyn's humor evaporated. "I will never allow my temper to get the best of me again. If I hadn't behaved so badly that Triona had felt compelled to come to London to rescue me, then she wouldn't have been forced to wed and -- " Caitlyn's throat tightened painfully. </p><p> Mary grasped her sister's hand. "It all worked out well in the end. Triona is deeply in love with her new husband and said she had you to thank that she met him. And you made Mam a very happy woman. She's excited as a lamb with a wool sweater about the match." </p><p> "Grandmother thinks anything having to do with the MacLeans is wondrous -- especially if it means she might get some great grandchildren out of it." </p><p> "Oh, that would be so -- " </p><p> A noisy thumping came from the hallway, sounding like a herd of romping calves. A fast knock later, the door was thrown open to reveal William, their oldest brother, followed by a surprisingly elegantly dressed Robert and a much-too-thin Michael. </p><p> They were all so tall, especially William, who, at twenty-one, had reached the impressive height of six feet four inches, his shoulders a proportionate width. </p><p> Michael, only recently recovered from another chest complaint, threw his lanky, sixteen-year-old length into the chair by the fireplace. "Well?" he asked, looking at the gowns and slippers and gewgaws placed on every surface of the room. "I thought you'd be packed by now!" </p><p> Mary grinned. "Caitlyn's only had two weeks to pack; you know that's not enough." </p><p> Caitlyn gave Michael a flat stare. "Have you all come to bother us? I assure you that we have enough to do without entertaining you." </p><p> Robert eyed the contents of the bed through a quizzing glass he'd recently taken to wearing. "Good God, woman! How much stuff are you taking with you?" </p><p> Caitlyn narrowed her gaze on her brother. "Must you use that ridiculous eyepiece?" </p><p> "It's the fashion," he said stoutly, though he looked somewhat uncertain. </p><p> "For a nearsighted Cyclops, perhaps." </p><p> Mary giggled while Michael and William snorted loudly. </p><p> Robert slipped the eyepiece into a pocket and said in a lofty tone, "Just because you don't appreciate good fashion -- " </p><p> "She does, too!" Mary interrupted. "You've seen the gowns she's made." </p><p> Caitlyn smoothed a blue morning gown on the bed. "If the list of amusements offered by the duchess is to be believed, I have fewer gowns than I need, but these will have to do. I can always change my wrap and shoes and make minor alterations so that my outfits look different." </p><p> "Caitlyn even redid her old riding gown." Mary reached into the portmanteau to touch with a loving hand the brown velvet riding habit. "When you return, will you help me make one like it?" </p><p> Michael snorted. "And where would you wear it? All we have to ride is the squire's old, fat mare." </p><p> Mary sniffed. "It doesn't matter what the horse looks like, just the rider." </p><p> "You spent hours making a riding habit you might only wear once or twice a month?" Michael appeared to be amazed at the thought. </p><p> "If it looked good on me, I might." </p><p> "Vanity is a sin. Father's told us that a million times." </p><p> "It's not vanity to wish to appear good; it's vanity if you think you look so good that it won't matter how you dress." </p><p> That opened up a discussion between Mary and Michael that grew in volume as Robert and William egged them on. </p><p> Caitlyn ignored them and tucked away a spangled shawl she'd purchased during her brief stay in London three months ago. <i>Has it only been that long?</i> The entire episode seemed a faded nightmare. </p><p> She couldn't clearly remember the balls and gowns anymore, or the sumptuous foods or town attractions, but she remembered every second she'd spent dangerously flirting with Alexander MacLean. She clearly recalled how she allowed him to teach her to ride. Though she'd made certain one of the grooms stayed nearby for appearance' sake, MacLean had quickly and easily dispensed with the man, sending him to fetch various "fallen" gloves or to look for a scarf that was blown away, even on days when there was no wind. </p><p> Her cheeks heated when she thought of her own participation in duping the servants. At the time, all she'd been able to think about was how much she wanted to feel MacLean's strong arms about her, how she longed for his heated kiss and -- She clamped the memories away. Those days were gone, and they'd meant less than the imaginary wind. </p><p> She forced herself to smile at Mary. "I'll make you a riding habit when I return. We can use the blue velvet from your old pelisse and that old gold opera cape Mother has in the trunk in the attic. The colors should be perfect, and if we place some silk flowers where the material is a bit worn, no one will notice. I did the same with one of my remade newer gowns." </p><p> Momentarily forgetting his jaded, man-about-town pose, Robert snorted. "You plan on hoaxing the crï¿½me of the ton with the clever placement of a few flowers? They'll be onto your hoax in a second." </p><p> Caitlyn folded a deep blue silk scarf and placed it into the portmanteau. "Oh, they'll never know. They didn't realize it before." She set a pair of satin slippers in the trunk beside the others. "Only three pairs of slippers. I wish I had two more." </p><p> William, who'd been lounging in the doorway, lifted his brows, a lazy twinkle in his eyes. "How many pairs of slippers are needed for a simple country house party?" </p><p> "It's not a simple house party at all," Mary protested. "It's at the castle of a real, live duchess!" </p><p> "I should have at least one pair of slippers for each color of gown. I shall just have to make do." Caitlyn placed the final gown into the trunk, carefully tucked it in, then closed the lid. "I keep expecting Mother to walk in and say she's changed her mind." </p><p> "She won't," Robert said, a superior tone in his voice. </p><p> Caitlyn eyed him. "How would you know?" </p><p> "I overheard her talking to Father. Mother thinks you will behave yourself for a few short weeks, and that you've made wonderful progress on your temper. You've hardly lost it at all in the last three months. Plus," he smirked, "she's hoping you'll meet someone eligible." </p><p> Caitlyn's cheeks burned. "I don't want to meet someone eligible." She just wanted the chance to reestablish the family name and prove to her parents that she'd learned from her horrible mistake. </p><p> Honestly, one thing that infuriated her about the incident was that no one seemed to place a bit of blame on MacLean, and he'd been just as much of a part of Triona's ruin as Caitlyn. If he hadn't been so intentionally <i>intriguing</i>, she'd never have paid him the least heed. But the second they'd met, he'd taunted and challenged her, and she'd discovered she didn't have the self-discipline to ignore him. </p><p> One thing was for certain, MacLean had been determined to kiss her: she knew because he'd told her so the third time they'd met. Of course, she'd then said something entirely inappropriate like "Just try it!" and that had been the beginning. </p><p> There'd been an unmistakable attraction between them, one that had flared hot and ready and left Caitlyn feeling things she'd never before felt. One kiss from Alexander MacLean reduced her to a quaking mas...</p></p><h2>Triumph Gt6 &amp; Vitesse</h2><p>Triumph GT6 and Vitesse (62 - 74 ) Classic Reprint</p><p></p><h2>Heading Out to Wonderful</h2><p><p>It is the summer of 1948 when a handsome, charismatic stranger, Charlie Beale, recently back from the war in Europe, shows up in the town of Brownsburg, a sleepy village nestled in the Valley of Virginia.

There are many, many books published each year that should never have been promoted beyond magazine articles. Fortunately, this is not one of them. Whether Newman is describing the science of extracting scent from the natural world, the technology of manufacturing perfume, the business of producing it, or the craft of selling it, she never fails to capture the reader's imagination, both with the indelible detail (a concentrate made from French jasmine sells for $12,000 a pound) and the fascinating historical aside (the fragrance industry in England was launched in 1573, when the earl of Oxford gave Queen Elizabeth I a pair of scented gloves). Perhaps most memorable is the chapter in which Newman describes her participation in a journey to the Costa Rican rain forest in search of new scents.

It is a world in which two generations of the Leong family live in an uneasy tension as they try to fathom the source of the middle daughter Ona's sorrow. Fae Myenne Ng's portraits of the everyday heroism of the Leongs--who inflict deep hurt on each other in their struggles to survive, yet sustain one another with loyalty and love--have made <em>Bone</em> one of the most critically acclaimed novels of recent years and immediately a classic of contemporary American life.</p><p>Fae Myenne Ng was born in San Francisco and now lives in New York City. Her short stories have appeared in <em>Harper's</em> and other magazines have been widely anthologized.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>We were a family of three girls. By Chinese standards, that wasn't lucky. In Chinatown, everyone knew our story. Outsiders jerked their chins, looked at us, shook their heads. We heard things. </p><p>"A failed family. That Dulcie Fu. And you know which one: bald Leon. Nothing but daughters." </p><p>Leon told us not to care about what people said. "People talking. People jealous." He waved a hand in the air. "Five sons don't make one good daughter." </p><p>I'm Leila, the oldest, Mah's first, from before Leon. Ona came next and then Nina. First, Middle, and End Girl. Our order of birth marked us and came to tell more than our given names. </p><p>Here's another bone for the gossipmongers. On vacation recently, visiting Nina in New York, I got married. I didn't marry on a whim--don't worry, I didn't do a green-card number. Mason Louie was no stranger. We'd been together four, five years, and it was time. </p><p>Leon was the first person I wanted to tell, so I went looking for him in Chinatown. He's not my real father, but he's the one who's been there for me. Like he always told me, it's time that makes a family, not just blood. </p><p>Mah and Leon are still married, but after Ona jumped off the Nam, Leon moved out. It was a bad time. Too much happened on Salmon Alley. We don't talk about it. Even the sewing ladies leave it alone. Anyway, it works out better that Mah and Leon don't live in the same place. When they're not feuding about the past, Leon visits Mah, helps her with the Baby Store, so they see enough of each other. </p><p>Leon's got a room at that old-man hotel on Clay Street, the San Fran. There's a toilet and bath on each floor and the lobby's used as a common room. No kitchen. I gave Leon a hot plate but he likes to have his meals either down the block at Uncle's Cafe or over at the Universal Cafe. </p><p>Leon's got the same room he had when he was a bachelor going out to sea every forty days. Our Grandpa Leong lived his last days at the San Fran, so it's an important place for us. In this country, the San Fran is our family's oldest place, our beginning place, our new China. The way I see it, Leon's life's kind of made a circle. </p><p>In the mornings, Leon likes to sit in the lobby timing the No-55 Sacramento buses, he likes to hassle the drivers if they're not on time. They humor him, call him Big Boss. It was just after eight when I got to the San Fran, but the lobby was empty. There was a thin comb of morning light on the dusty rose-colored sofa, and the straight-back chairs were still pushed up against the wall, at their tidy night angles. When I pulled the accordion doors of the elevator back, they unfolded into a diamond pattern with a loud clang. I yanked the lever back and held it there until the number 8 floated by on the wheel contraption Leon called the odometer; then I jerked the handle forward and the elevator stopped level to the ninth floor. Leon's room was at the end of the corridor, next to the fire escape. </p><p>"Leon?" I knocked. "Leon!" I jiggled the doorknob and it turned. Leon forgets the simplest things--like locking the door: another reason it's better he doesn't live with Mah. </p><p>Without Leon, the room looked dingier. There was an old-man smell, and junk all over. Leon was a junk inventor. Very weird stuff. An electric sink. Cookie-tin clocks. Clock lamps. An intercom hooked up to a. cash register hooked up to the alarm system. When they lived together, Mah put up with it all: his screws, his odd beginnings of projects scattered all over her kitchen table, on their bedside. But the day after he shipped out on a voyage, she threw everything into the garbage. She called it his <i>lop sop.</i> But that didn't stop Leon, who continued inventing on the long voyages. On the ships, his bunk was his only space, so every invention was compact. Leon made a miniature of everything: fan, radio, rice cooker. And he brought them all home.</p><p>Leon was a collector, too. Stacks of takeout containers, a pile of aluminum tins. Plastic bags filled with packs of ketchup and sugar. White cans with red letters, government-issue vegetables: sliced beets, waxy green beans, squash. His nightstand was a red restaurant stool cluttered with towers of Styrofoam cups, stacks of restaurant napkins, and a cup of assorted fast-food straws. Metal hangers dangled from the closet doorknob. On the windowsill were bunches of lotus leaves and coils of dried noodles. There were several tin cans: one held balls of knotted red string, another brimmed with tangles of rubber bands. The third was ashy with incense punks. Beyond these tins, I could see Colt Tower. </p><p>When I visited Leon, he'd make me coffee, boiling water in a pan and straining the grounds like an herbal tea, and then he'd show me every project he had in progress: alarm clocks, radios, lamps, and tape recorders. He'd read to me from his newspaper piles: <i>The Chinese Times, The China Daily News, Wah Kue, World News, Ming Bao.</i> Leon snipped and saved the best stories for his private collection: Lost Husbands, Runaway Wives, Ungrateful Children. </p><p>Leon kept his private stash of money, what he called his Going-Back-to-China fund, in a brown bag tucked into an old blanket of Ona's. I called it his petty-cash bag. I slipped a red envelope inside.</p></p><h2>Reads (Cerebus)</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

This is one of the most powerful editions in the series and one of the most ambitious narratives that Dave Sim has ever attempted.<p> In addition, <i>Reads</i> is the most controversial volume of the Cerebus series to date because of a parallel narrative involving two characters--Viktor Reid and Viktor Davis--who are both alter egos for Dave Sim. This controversy is a shame because the offensive section in <i>Reads</i>--which explores the relationship between men and women--represents only one possible view of this subject. When read as part of the whole series, the passages that may have seemed shocking to some, appear (like all points of this narrative) to question and provoke rather than offend. Viktor Davis is far from a reliable narrator, an idea that is reinforced by the final paragraphs of his narrative and demonstrated by the scariest of all Cerebus practical jokes. Are Viktor Davis or Viktor Reid representative of Dave Sim or simply aspects of his persona? The ending suggests the answer.</p><p> Meanwhile, Cerebus, Po, Cirin, and Astoria debate the important stuff, including our aardvark friend's genitalia, the history of Illusionism, the nature of power, and the fate of Astoria's child.

Somerset Maugham&#x2019;s own true story has never been fully told. At last, the fascinating truth is revealed in a landmark biography by the award-winning writer Selina Hastings. Granted unprecedented access to Maugham&#x2019;s personal correspondence and to newly uncovered interviews with his only child, Hastings portrays the secret loves, betrayals, integrity, and passion that inspired Maugham to create such classics as <i>The Razor&#x2019;s Edge</i> and <i>Of Human Bondage</i>.<br><br>Hastings vividly presents Maugham&#x2019;s lonely childhood spent with unloving relatives after the death of his parents, a trauma that resulted in shyness, a stammer, and for the rest of his life an urgent need for physical tenderness. Here, too, are his adult triumphs on the stage and page, works that allowed him a glittering social life in which he befriended and sometimes fell out with such luminaries as Dorothy Parker, Charlie Chaplin, D. H. Lawrence, and Winston Churchill.<br><br><b>The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham</b> portrays in full for the first time Maugham&#x2019;s disastrous marriage to Syrie Wellcome, a manipulative society woman of dubious morality who trapped Maugham with a pregnancy and an attempted suicide. Hastings also explores Maugham&#x2019;s many affairs with men, including his great love, Gerald Haxton, an alcoholic charmer and a cad. Maugham&#x2019;s courageous work in secret intelligence during two world wars is described in fascinating detail&#x2014;experiences that provided the inspiration for the groundbreaking Ashenden stories. From the West End to Broadway, from China to the South Pacific, Maugham&#x2019;s restless and remarkably productive life is thrillingly recounted as Hastings uncovers the real stories behind such classics as &#x201c;Rain,&#x201d; The Painted Veil, Cakes &amp; Ale, and other well-known tales.<br><br>An epic biography of a hugely talented and hugely conflicted man, <i>The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham</i> is the definitive account of Maugham&#x2019;s extraordinary life.</p><p>Selina Hastings worked at the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> before becoming the literary editor for<i> Harpers &amp; Queen</i>.

He was known everywhere for his superb short stories and for his novels, the immensely acclaimed, Of Human Bondage, becoming one of the most widely read works of fiction of the twentieth century. His books were translated into almost every known tongue, filmed, dramatized, and sold in their millions, bringing&nbsp;<br>him celebrity and enormous wealth. Wherever he went he was pursued by journalists, eager for information: this extraordinary man seemed to know everyone, from Henry James to Winston Churchill, from Dorothy Parker to D. H. Lawrence. His magnificent villa in the south of France, much photographed and written about, was a byword for luxury and elegance. On the Riviera, as in London and New York, Maugham, always elegantly dressed, looked every inch the conventional English gentleman. And yet conventional he was not. In Maugham&#x2019;s outwardly respectable life there was a great deal he was determined to keep hidden, and in old age, when he was besieged by would-be biographers, he did his utmost to make sure his privacy would remain intact. Evening after evening at the Villa Mauresque, Maugham, assisted by his secretary, went systematically through his papers, throwing every last scrap of personal correspondence onto the fire. He also wrote to his friends asking them to destroy any letters of his in their possession; and he issued strict instructions to his literary executors that no biography should be authorized, no access to his papers be allowed, and all requests for information be firmly refused.<br><br>And what were these areas of experience that it was so important to keep concealed? Mainly they were to do with his homosexuality, for Maugham lived in an era when in Britain homosexual practice was against the law. He was twenty-one at the time of the trial of Oscar Wilde in 1895, an event that traumatized a generation of men who were not by nature inclined toward marriage. And although Maugham himself did marry, and indeed fathered a child, his relations with his wife, Syrie, were wretchedly unhappy, even though he never allowed her for long to keep him apart from the great love of his life, a dissolute charmer named Gerald Haxton. Now, nearly half a century after Maugham&#x2019;s death, the details of his long affair with Gerald and the harrowing story of his life with Syrie have come to light. The executors of the Maugham estate in London, the Royal Literary Fund, recently rescinded the clause in his will forbidding access to his correspondence; and a transcript has been uncovered of a long and detailed recording made by his daughter, Liza, of the inside story of her father&#x2019;s private and domestic life. The material has turned out to be richly revealing: Liza, speaking to a close friend, was extremely frank; and ironically, Maugham&#x2019;s request that his letters should be destroyed ensured not only that they were kept but that most were sold for very large sums to American universities.<br>The story that unfolds is that of a man who after a harrowing and unhappy childhood learned early to live undercover; appropriately, in both world wars he worked for British intelligence, sometimes at considerable risk to his personal safety. He was further distanced by developing at an early age a stammer that made him agonizingly self-conscious; it inhibited him, and as an adult he formed the habit of having by his side an interpreter, a sociable, outgoing type, usually also his lover, who would make the initial contact and enable Maugham himself to keep more or less in the background. And yet for all his elaborate defenses Maugham remained intensely vulnerable; he was a passionate, difficult man, capable of cruelty as well as of great kindness and charm, but despite all his worldly success he never found what he wanted. His miserable marriage wrecked years of his existence, and the great love of his life remained unrequited.<br><br>Many of his readers associate Somerset Maugham with the British Empire and the Far East, with Maugham himself a symbol of the quintessential English gentleman, the pukka sahib, descended from generations of old established county family. Yet in fact Maugham&#x2019;s parents were recent arrivals among the professional middle classes, and they had lived not in England but in France: it was on French soil that Maugham&#x2019;s life both began and ended. Maugham&#x2019;s father, Robert Ormond Maugham (1823&#x2013;1884), was a solicitor, the third generation to practice law in a family who were descended from farmers and small tradesmen in Westmoreland. It was Robert Maugham&#x2019;s grandfather who had first come to London, where he had risen no higher than a lawyer&#x2019;s clerk, although his son had gone on to achieve distinction not only in his legal practice but as one of the founders of the Law Society. Robert himself had done so well in the family business that in the 1840s he had moved to Paris to open a branch there, his partner, William Dixon, remaining behind to run the London office. The premises of Maugham et Dixon, juriconsultes anglais, were immediately opposite the British embassy, and here Maugham et Dixon prospered, especially after the firm&#x2019;s semiofficial appointment as legal adviser to the embassy itself.<br><br>By his mid-thirties Robert Maugham was making a good living, doing well from the boom years of Louis Napoleon and the Second Empire, when in Paris everyone seemed to be making money&#x2014;&#x201c;Enrichissez-vous!&#x201d; was the cry. The population of the capital was enormously expanding, and so was the English community upon which much of the business of Maugham et Dixon naturally depended. Eventually Robert Maugham felt sufficiently well off to take a wife, and on the first of October 1863, at the age of thirty-nine, he married Edith Mary Snell, a ravishing young woman sixteen years his junior. Young Mrs. Maugham, daughter of an Indian army captain who had died when she was a baby, had lived in France most of her life. Her widowed mother had been socially superior to her husband, and it was one of her uncles who had been christened Somerset in honor of a distinguished godfather, the name to be passed on to his famous great-nephew, who never cared for it.<br><br>After the wedding the Maughams settled into an apartment at 25 Avenue d&#x2019;Antin (now Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt), a broad street lined with chestnut trees just below the rond-point of the Champs-ï¿½lysï¿½es. Here for nearly seven years the couple enjoyed an agreeable existence, with Robert, &#x201c;lively and gregarious,&#x201d; working hard at his business while Edith ran the household and supervised the upbringing of the three boys who arrived in quick succession. Both Maughams were small in stature, but while Robert&#x2019;s appearance verged on the brutish&#x2014;he was plump, with a large sallow face, yellow whites to his eyes, and a bulbous chin framed by a mustache and bushy side whiskers&#x2014;Edith was doll-like and beautiful. Her hair was a rich auburn, her pale complexion flawless, her dark brown eyes large and set wide apart. When Robert and Edith were seen together, the contrast was almost risible, and they became affectionately known as &#x201c;Beauty and the Beast.&#x201d; The Maughams enjoyed a lavish style of living, keeping a carriage, frequently attending the theater and opera, and entertaining generously. Edith dressed with style, the apartment was always filled with flowers, and the finest hothouse fruit, grapes and peaches out of season, appeared on the table. Much of the Maughams&#x2019; social life inevitably revolved around the embassy, but Edith also numbered among her friends writers and painters, among them Prosper Mï¿½rimï¿½e and Gustave Dorï¿½. Regarded as the reigning beauty of the English community, Mme Maugham was one of the few foreigners whose name was listed in the annual directory La Sociï¿½tï¿½ et le High Life, and after her death she was described as an habituï¿½e of the most elegant salons, &#x201c;une femme charmante, qui ne comptait que des amis dans la haute sociï¿½tï¿½ parisienne, oï¿½ elle occupait une des premiï¿½res places.&#x201d;* Such a eulogy almost certainly owes more to flattery than fact, but it is nonetheless clear that Edith Maugham was a woman of exceptional empathy and charm.<br><br>In October 1865 the couple&#x2019;s first child was born, a boy, Charles Ormond, followed a year later by Frederic Herbert, and in June 1868 by Henry Neville. The youngest had barely reached his second birthday when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, shortly followed by Napoleon III&#x2019;s humiliating surrender in September 1870 at Sedan. With the Prussian army advancing on Paris, the Maughams, together with a large section of the English community, departed for England, leaving behind them at the Avenue d&#x2019;Antin a couple of servants to look after the apartment and a Union Jack fastened to the balcony. During the terrible siege of Paris the starving populace was reduced to eating rats and animals from the zoo; as nothing could penetrate the German blockade, messages arrived from the Avenue d&#x2019;Antin by carrier pigeon, one of them requesting to know whether Madame desired the summer covers to be put on the furniture in the drawing room. The five-month siege was succeeded by the bloody civil war known as the Commune, during which great swaths of the city were destroyed and more than twenty thousand people killed. But by the end of May 1871, government forces had regained control, and in August the Maughams returned to Paris, met at the Gare du Nord by their loyal manservant, Franï¿½ois, who was able to tell them that the apartment had been left untouched by the Germans, thanks largely to their prominently displayed Union Jack.<br><br>The apartment may have remained intact, but most of the center of the city presented a scene of desolation, the Tuileries a blackened ruin, the Hï¿½tel de Ville a heap of rubble, the Colonne Vendï¿½me toppled to the ground. Although rebuilding began at once and progressed with speed, it was some time before the business life of the city fully recovered, and with so many English having gone for good, Robert Maugham found himself perilously out of pocket, obliged to start almost from scratch in rebuilding his practice.<br><br>In 1873 Edith again found herself pregnant. At that time the government, understandably anxious to strengthen its military might, was threatening the introduction of legislation imposing French nationality on all boys born in France to foreign parents, a measure that would automatically make them eligible for conscription. To circumvent this, the British ambassador, Lord Lyons, had authorized the rigging up of a maternity ward on the second floor of the embassy so that the wives of those immediately connected to the Chancery could safely give birth on British soil. And here on January 25, 1874, Edith&#x2019;s fourth child was born, another boy, to be christened William Somerset.<br><br>The years of Somerset Maugham&#x2019;s early childhood were almost certainly the happiest of his life. By the time he was old enough to take notice, his three brothers, Charlie, Freddie, and Harry, had gone, sent off to school in England and coming home only for the holidays. The result was that little William led the life of a much-indulged only child, and with his father away at his office all day, returning only after the boy had been put to bed, he was in the happy position of having his adored mother entirely to himself. After the departure of his wet nurse, Willie was looked after by a French nursemaid, his &#x201c;nounou,&#x201d; with whom he shared a bedroom, and it was she who would take him in to see his mother in the morning while she was resting after her bath, a private interlude of perfect intimacy and love, the memory of which stayed with him always, to be poignantly recalled nearly forty years later:<br><br>[The servant] took the child over to a bed in which a woman was lying. It was his mother. She stretched out her arms, and the child nestled by her sid . . . .?The woman kissed his eyes, and with thin, small hands felt the warm body through his white flannel nightgow . . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sleepy, darling?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&nbsp;. . . The child did not answer, but smiled comfortably. He was very happy in the large, warm bed, with those soft arms about him. He tried to make himself smaller still as he cuddled up against his mother, and he kissed her sleepily. In a moment he closed his eyes and was fast aslee . . . .?[T]he woman kissed him again; and she passed her hand down his body till she came to his feet; she held the right foot in her hand and felt the five small toes; and then slowly passed her hand over the left one.<br><br>For Willie, his mother was the center of his entire existence. He loved her unreservedly and felt completely secure in her love for him. While his father remained a shadowy presence and barely impinged upon his consciousness, his mother&#x2019;s attention, he knew, was always his, and nothing mattered to him much that did not concern the sweet intimacy that existed between himself and her.<br><br>After visiting his mother, Willie was taken out, usually to play in the Champs-ï¿½lysï¿½es, in those days lined with private houses and luxurious apartment buildings. He and his nurse would make their way to the gardens at the end nearest the Place de la Concorde. Here there were always other children, and as he grew older Willie was allowed to play with them, dashing in and out of the shrubbery in vigorous games of La tour prend garde or Balle ï¿½ l&#x2019;ennemi. With his pale skin, fair curls, and large brown eyes, Willie in his black-belted suit was indistinguishable from the little French boys in their short trousers and lace-up boots who were his playmates; indeed he spoke French far more fluently than English, sometimes mixing the two. Edith was amused when one day her small son, catching sight of a horse from the window of a railway carriage, cried out, &#x201c;Regardez, Maman, voilï¿½ un &#x2019;orse.&#x201d; His first extant letter, written at the age of six and addressed to his parents, is in French: &#x201c;cher papa, chere maman, votre petit willie est heureux au jour de noel de vous exprimer ses meilleurs souhaits, et sa reconaissante affection. croyez-moi, cher papa, chere maman, votre fils respectueux, willie maugham.&#x201d;* In the afternoons, either his mother had nursery tea with him, or Willie went to the drawing room to be shown off to her guests. Occasionally he was asked to recite a fable of La Fontaine, after which, if he were lucky, some kind gentleman might tip him. On his seventh birthday one of his mother&#x2019;s friends gave him a twenty-franc piece, which he chose to spend on his first visit to the theater; accompanied by his eldest brother Charlie, he saw Sarah Bernhardt in an &#x201c;atrocious&#x201d; melodrama by Sardou, which thrilled him to the core.</p><h2>Recursion (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic)</h2><p>&#34;That&#39;s what NYC cop Barry Sutton is learning, as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome--a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.

Information is being communicated differently. Misinformation is developing its techniques. On a world scale emigration has become the principal means of survival. The national state of those who had suffered the worst genocide in history has become, militarily speaking, fascist. National states in general have been politically downsized and reduced to the role of vassals serving the new world economic order. The visionary political vocabulary of three centuries has been garbaged. In short, the economic and military global tyranny of today has been established.<br><br>At the same time new methods of resistance to this tyranny are being discovered. Rebels now have to be not so much obedient as self-reliant. Within the growing opposition centralized authority has been replaced by spontaneous co-operation. Long-term programmes are replaced by urgent alliances over specific issues. Civil society is learning and beginning to practice the guerrilla tactics of political resistance.<br><br>Today the desire for justice is multitudinous. This is to say that struggles against injustice, struggles for survival, for self-respect, for human rights, should never be considered merely in terms of their immediate demands, their organizations, or their historical consequences. They cannot be reduced to &#x2018;movements&#x2019;. A movement describes a mass of people collectively moving towards a definite goal, which they either achieve or fail to achieve. Yet such a description ignores, or does not take into account, the countless personal choices, encounters, illuminations, sacrifices, new desires, griefs and, finally, memories, which the movement brought about, but which are, in the strict sense, incidental to that movement. <br><br>The promise of a movement is its future victory; whereas the promises of the incidental moments are instantaneous. Such moments include, life-enhancingly or tragically, experiences of freedom in action. (Freedom without actions does not exist.) Such moments&#x2014;as no historical &#x2018;outcome&#x2019; can ever be&#x2014;are transcendental, are what Spinoza termed eternal, and they are as multitudinous as the stars in an expanding universe. <br><br>Not all desires lead to freedom, but freedom is the experience of a desire being acknowledged, chosen and pursued. Desire never concerns the mere possession of something, but the changing of something. Desire is a wanting. A wanting now. Freedom does not constitute the fulfilment of that wanting, but the acknowledgement of its supremacy.<br>Today the infinite is beside the poor.</p><h2>The Power of Grace: Recognizing Unexpected Gifts on Our Path</h2><p><b>The universe supports you and is offering to help you&#x2014;in very concrete ways.

Puffin Modern Classics are relaunched under a new logo: A Puffin Book. There are 20 titles to collect in the series, listed below, all with exciting new covers and fun-filled endnotes. Clive King&#39;s Stig of the Dump is a much-loved modern classic. It is the story of Barney and his best friend, cave-man Stig. Barney is a solitary little boy, given to wandering off by himself. One day he is lying on the edge of a disused chalk-pit when it gives way and he lands in a sort of cave. Here he meets &#39;somebody with a lot of shaggy hair and two bright black eyes&#39; wearing a rabbit skin and speaking in grunts. He names him Stig. Of course nobody believes Barney when he tells his family all about Stig, but for Barney cave-man Stig is totally real. They become great friends, learning each others ways and embarking on a series of unforgettable adventures. Clive King was born in Richmond, Surrey, in 1924. When he was young his family moved to a village called Ash, near Sevenoaks in Kent, which is the setting for Stig of the Dump. He went to Downing College, Cambridge, and the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He then served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. His service as a sailor and his work as a language teacher took him all over the world. Clive King lives with his family in Norfolk and is a full-time writer.

Caught between the casual comfort of a relationship with a male buddy and the domestic responsibilities of a wife and child in a racist America that assaults him at every turn, Manfred seeks easy answers in "Dirty Bird" (Old Crow whiskey) and in moving on. But the blues in his soul and the dreams in his mind keep bringing him back to face himself. After a nightmarish descent into his own depths, Manfred emerges with fresh awareness and possibility.<br>Through Manfred we witness and experience the process by which modern American English has been vitalized and strengthened by the poetry and the poignancy of the African-American experience.<br>As Manfred struggles with the constraints of society and his private turmoil, his rich inner voice resonates with the blues.</p><p>Clarence Major is an avant-garde novelist, short-story writer, and poet known for his bold experiments with language and style. What many don&#39;t know, however, is that Major can be a fine storyteller, capable of bringing his formidable talents to more conventional narrative forms as in this novel. This is the story of Manfred Banks, a blues musician in the early 1950s. We follow Man, as he&#39;s nicknamed, as he tries to woo his estranged wife, Cleo, as he struggles to make a living playing his music in Chicago, and then leaves for Omaha, where he finds work in a steel mill, and a weekend gig playing in a bar. When Cleo rejoins him things look as if they are finally coming together, but this is the kind of man for whom the blues line &#34;if it wasn&#39;t for no luck, I wouldn&#39;t have no luck at all&#34; was written. Major has written a fine, compelling novel, with language and characters as rich as the blues songs that are its inspiration.Major, a prolific man of letters, seems to have abandoned for good the experimental styles that characterized much of his early work (My Amputations, 1986, etc.). His latest is a quite conventional morality tale dressed up with his extensive, if somewhat academic, knowledge of Afro-American slang. The lexicographer in Major (Juba to Jive: A Dictionary of African-American Slang, not reviewed) gets the better of him in an otherwise simple narrative about black life circa 1950. Manfred Banks, 25, born in Georgia, hates the winters in Chicago. An aspiring bluesman, he can't find day work and spends most of his waking hours in pursuit of the ``Dirty Bird'' (Old Crow whiskey). His wife has taken their baby girl to live with a preacher man, and his only friend, guitarist Solomon Thigpen, is also singing the ``dirty bird blues.'' A violent episode with the preacher and the police encourages Man to head to Omaha, where his older sister is leading a model life; her husband even lands Man a job at a steel plant, while Man begins gigging on weekends at the local hot spot. Soon Man's family joins him, and prospects look good until some racists at work decide to harass him. He retreats further into the bottle. When Solomon comes west, Man's wife fears the worst. But a long, drunken night, during which Man sees ``something deep and ugly come out'' in himself, sets him on the road to sobriety. This simple tale is punctuated with long stream-of-consciousness dream sequences in which Manfred imagines what success might be like, worries about losing his wife to Jesus, and sees himself lynched. Major also employs an extensive knowledge of the blues idiom- -Manfred is constantly thinking in lyrics, even if the moment doesn't seem to warrant it. There's a powerful, persuasive use of language here, but it's suspended in too studied a tale--one that never gets cooking. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Easy of disposition and eager to experience life at its richest, McBride jumped in with both feet.</p><p>But this wasn't a typical fishing outfit. McBride had been unwittingly recruited into a band of smugglers--middlemen between a Colombian marijuana cartel and their distributors in Miami.

Moving with the tide of historical events, <em>The Painter from Shanghai</em> celebrates a singularly daring painting style&#x2015;one that led to fame, notoriety, and, ultimately, a devastating choice: between Pan's art and the one great love of her life.</p><p>Jennifer Cody Epstein is the author of the international best-selling novel The Painter from Shanghai, The Gods of Heavenly Punishment (the 2013 Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association adult fiction honor recipient), and most recently, Wunderland.

Epstein earned her MFA in fiction from Columbia University and an MA in international affairs from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and two daughters.Starred Review. Epstein's sweeping debut novel, set in early 20th-century China, fictionalizes the life of Chinese painter Pan Yuliang. Born Xiuquing, she is orphaned at a young age and later sold into prostitution by her uncle, who needs the money to support his opium habit. Renamed Yuliang, she becomes the brothel's top girl and soon snags the attention of customs inspector Pan Zanhua, who makes her his concubine. Zanhua sets her up in Shanghai, where she enrolls in the Shanghai Art Academy and early on struggles with life study, unable to separate the nude's monetary value from its value in the currency of beauty. She eventually succeeds, winning a scholarship to study in Europe. But when she returns to China, itself inching toward revolution, the conservative establishment is critical of Yuliang, balking as she adopts Western-style dress and becomes known for her nudes (one newspaper deems her work pornography). Simmering resentments hit a flashpoint at a disastrous Shanghai retrospective exhibit, and the fallout nearly destroys Yuliang's artistic ambition. Convincing historic detail is woven throughout and nicely captures the plight of women in the era. Epstein's take on Yuliang's life is captivating to the last line. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p>KEN KESEY was born in 1935 in Colorado and grew up in Oregon.

Most meteorites originate from asteroids, a few come from the planet Mars or the moon, and some may even come from comets. Meteorites from asteroids are the oldest objects available for study, dating back to the very first stages of solar system formation, about 4,570 million years ago. The study of meteorites provides a window back in time, so we can learn about the processes that formed and shaped the solar system, and the planets, moons, asteroids and comets it contains, including our own Earth.</p> <p>Meteorites are divided into three main types on the basis of their composition. Stone meteorites are composed mainly of silicate minerals similar to those found in rocks on Earth. Iron meteorites are composed of iron metal alloyed with nickel. Stony-iron meteorites, as their name suggests, are composed of a mixture of iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals. These different meteorite types are further described in chapter 4.</p> <p><b>Meteors, meteoroids, fireballs and meteorites</b></p> <p>About 40,000-60,000 t of extraterrestrial material falls on the Earth every year. Before entering Earth's atmosphere these fragments are known as meteoroids, and individual pieces can range in size from tiny, microscopic grains of dust to large bodies, many metres in diameter. The vast majority of the material that lands on Earth is in the form of tiny dust grains, usually less than 1 mm (1/25 in) in size, known as cosmic dust, micrometeorites or interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). Because these objects are so small, they radiate away the frictional heating produced as they pass through the atmosphere faster than they melt, and thus survive intact to land on Earth.</p> <p>You may have been lucky enough to have seen a meteor or 'shooting star'. These streaks of light are produced by larger objects, perhaps the size of a small pebble. The effects of frictional heating as such objects pass through Earth's atmosphere are great enough to melt and vaporize the material, producing a very rapid, bright streak in the night sky. At some times during the year many meteors can be observed over a period of a few days. These 'meteor showers' are related to the orbits of known comets and occur at well-defined times during the year (see chapter 5). Meteors do not result in meteorites. It is extremely rare for material from a meteor to be recovered on Earth.</p> <p>If still larger fragments (many centimetres or even metres in size) enter Earth's atmosphere they can produce spectacular light and sound effects as they fall. As they pass through the Earth's atmosphere these are called fireballs. Meteorites may land on Earth as a result of a large meteoroid entering the Earth's atmosphere. A meteoroid travels in space at its cosmic velocity, about 30 km/s (67,500 mph). When it reaches the Earth's atmosphere it is slowed down by friction and these frictional forces also act on its outermost surface, heating it to melting temperature.</p> <p>Only the outermost surface of the meteoroid melts and the resulting droplets of molten material are carried away as the meteoroid speeds through the atmosphere. (This is unlike meteors, where the entire object is vaporized and destroyed.) The rapid speed of the meteoroid as it enters the atmosphere also generates shock waves (sonic booms), which are often heard as explosions. As the meteoroid is further slowed down by the atmosphere it begins to cool rapidly and its molten surface forms a glassy coating called the fusion crust. Finally, it falls to the ground under the influence of gravity and is now termed a meteorite.</p> <p>Sometimes one side of the meteorite may be curved or even conical in shape. This is the 'leading edge' of the meteorite, the side that pointed in the direction the meteoroid travelled during its passage through the atmosphere. If the meteorite has tumbled during its flight it will have a more irregular shape, although it should still retain rounded edges. Note that only the outermost surface of the meteoroid melts, while the interior remains cold and unchanged. Meteorites are almost always cold when they land. The very few reports of meteorites that have been recovered almost immediately after landing state that they are cold or slightly warm at most.</p> <p>Meteorites fall more or less randomly over the Earth's surface and a number of studies have been carried out to estimate how many meteorites land on Earth every year. Some studies use cameras to image the night sky and record the number of observed fireballs, while other studies use the number of meteorites found in desert regions. Estimates indicate approximately 5,000 to 17,000 meteorites larger than 100 g (3 1/2 oz) -- about the size of a golf ball -- fall on Earth every year. However, it is important to remember that 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by water and any meteorites landing in the oceans are unlikely ever to be recovered. Similarly, many parts of the world remain uninhabited or only have sparsely distributed populations, so any meteorites landing in these areas are unlikely to be seen by anyone.</p> <p>Every year only a handful of meteorites are witnessed to fall and are then recovered -- these are known as 'fall' meteorites. In 2007, for example, there were seven authenticated 'fall' meteorites reported. </p> <p>In some places, however, meteorites can be preserved or concentrated by natural processes. Most meteorites contain some proportion of metal, and the arid conditions found in the hot and cold deserts help to preserve them by slowing down the weathering and rusting that destroys the meteorites. Hot and cold deserts have provided extremely fertile meteorite hunting grounds, with tens of thousands of meteorites recovered so far. Meteorites that are found after they fell, either by chance or during dedicated collecting trips, are termed 'find' meteorites. Meteorite falls and finds are discussed further in chapter 2.</p> <p><b>The study of meteorites -- fireballs and thunderstones</b></p> <p>Meteors, fireballs and meteorite falls have been observed and recorded since ancient times. Chinese astronomers recorded meteor showers around 700 BC, and objects including daggers and jewellery made from meteoritic iron have been recovered from Egyptian pyramids, including the famous tomb of Tutankhamen. In 1928, archaeologists excavating a prehistoric Native American settlement near the town of Winona in northern Arizona excavated a 24-kg (53-lb) meteorite that had been carefully buried in a purpose-built crypt, or 'cist'. The archaeological setting suggests that the builders of the settlement treated the meteorite as an important object. However, the Sinagua tribe were only in the area for around 200 years from the eleventh century, and therefore the meteorite is unlikely to have been a witnessed fall.</p> <p>The oldest meteorite seen to fall, and which is still preserved, is the Nogata meteorite that fell in the garden of the Suga Jinja Shinto shrine in Japan, over 1,100 years ago. Realizing the importance of the object, the shrine priests preserved it in a box as a special treasure. Although no written records exist, the story of the fall was passed down through the generations. In 1922, the head priest contacted a local geologist to ask his opinion on the stone and the geologist declared that it was indeed a meteorite. Then, in 1979, analyzes on a small piece of the stone confirmed this.</p> <p>The first meteorite fall for which written records exist is the Ensisheim meteorite, which fell on the village of Ensisheim (now in the Alsace region of France) in 1492. A large fireball was observed and, after a large explosion, which caused much fright and excitement amongst the local people, a 127-kg (280-lb) stone fell on Ensisheim. This event was deemed so unusual and important it was recorded at the time in an engraving and was reported to the Emperor Maximillian, who ordered that the stone be preserved in the village church. The stone can still be seen in Ensisheim although it</p></p><h2>Christ Our Advocate</h2><p>&#34;Studies in Polemical Theology, Jurisprudence and Canon Law.&#34; Fifteen essays and four book reviews covering religion and law, social ethics, and the defence of Christian faith.

When Violette was born, Mesopotamia had been Ottoman for some 600 years, until redrawn as Iraq by the British when Violette was eight years old. This bittersweet memoir tells of a childhood spent in the city of Caliphs, Scheherazade and the land of the Garden of Eden, of traditions passed down over the generations, and captures vividly the elusive quality of a scene totally at odds with our image of today&#39;s Iraq. As a privileged young woman growing up with her extended family in the city of The Thousand and One Nights, Violette re-lives the excitement of a vibrant society coming to terms with daily life, first under Ottoman, then British, and finally, pro-Nazi rule, which ended in disaster for the Jews of Iraq, who were brutally attacked in two days of slaughter in May 1941 while British troops stood by, under orders not to intervene.The pogrom, which sounded the death-knell for the oldest community in the Diaspora, has been sidelined in history. Now, in a final section in the memoir, the editors reveal the steps that led to the catastrophe and the British bungling that brought it about. Like Anne Frank&#39;s diary, &#34;Memories of Eden&#34; tells of an easy and happy childhood, of growing maturity and sophistication, and then shrinking circumstances, victimisation and, finally, flight.</p><p>The AuthorViolette was born in Baghdad in 1912, and lived with her brothers and sisters on the riverbank in a &#39;castle&#39; built by their father in Ottoman days. She grew up in Arcadian conditions, an Arab of the Jewish faith, witnessing Mesopotamia&#39;s emergence from a primitive past to a modern present and a future full of promise.But when the Jews were attacked in the pogrom of 1941, she and her young family fled to start a new life in India, and after that, Palestine. The combination of Violette&#39;s acute asthma and Israel&#39;s war of independence meant that the family fled once more - to Cyprus. The following years were spent between the island and Israel, before finally settling in London in 1964.A cultured and educated lady, Violette was passionately interested in Jewish Iraqi history, and for over 20 years sent jottings, letters, and short essays to her daughter, Mira. These Memories of Eden have now been edited by Mira and her journalist husband, and published for a broader audience. Violette died in 2006.The EditorsTony Rocca is a journalist, author and winemaker, the grandson of the Italian immigrant who bestowed the name Manchester United on the struggling soccer club once known as Newton Heath (no shares passed down the line).Born near Manchester and educated at Rossall, at the age of 17 he began working for a local paper, the Stockport Express. In 1964 he joined the Daily Mail where he worked for 10 years. There followed a further decade in London with The Sunday Times as reporter, feature-writer, Insight investigator and foreign correspondent with specialised interest in Greece, Cyprus and the Middle East.Tony&#39;s 15 minutes of fame came with the demise of Sir James Goldsmith&#39;s Now! magazine which he joined as deputy news editor on the very morning it became Then! Next came a brief period as features editor of the Mail on Sunday and several years freelancing. His articles have appeared in most British national newspapers as well as The New York Times and Reader&#39;s Digest.In 1989 he and his wife Mira returned to his family&#39;s Italian roots and invested their savings in a dilapidated Tuscan farmhouse. The story of the pitfalls and adversity that can confront the &#39;good life&#39; novice, ending in unprecedented success for the wine they produced, formed his first book, Catching Fireflies, published by Century in 2004 (Arrow, 2005).This is an extraordinary, unique and invaluable book. Violette Shamash, who died in 2006, tells the story of the Jewish community in Baghdad in the first half of the 20th century. She writes beautifully and her book is superbly readable. She describes in exquisite detail the histories, lives and customs of Iraq&#39;s Jews through the evocative stories of her own family. This astonishing record has been put together by Violette&#39;s daughter Mira and her husband Tony Rocca from letters, notes and essays written by Violette over a period of 20 years. These tell the story of a cultivated and well integrated Jewish community in the heart of Muslim Arabia during the end of the Ottoman Empire and the British Mandate. Memories of Eden is a superb account of a long forgotten time - indeed a time which is barely imaginable now, given the hatreds that currently exist in the Middle East. Until the Second World War, Jews and Muslims lived side by side, she writes. &#34;We were treated as equals and accepted on our own merit until the poison of Nazism and Arab nationalism entered the bloodstream.

Most scientists don't care how they are perceived, but in our media-dominated age, style points count.<br><br> Enter Randy Olson.&nbsp; Fifteen years ago, Olson bid farewell to the science world and shipped off to Hollywood ready to change the world. With films like <i>Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus</i> (Tribeca '06, Showtime) and <i>Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy</i> (Outfest '08), he has tried to bridge the cultural divide that has too often left science on the outside looking in.<br><br> Now, in his first book, Olson, with a Harvard Ph.D. and formerly a tenured professor of marine biology at the University of New Hampshire, recounts the lessons from his own hilarious-and at times humiliating-evolution from science professor to Hollywood filmmaker.&nbsp; In <i>Don't Be Such a Scientist</i>, he shares the secrets of talking substance in an age of style. The key, he argues, is to stay true to the facts while tapping into something more primordial, more irrational, and ultimately more human.<br><br> In a book enlivened by a profane acting teacher who made Olson realize that "nobody wants to watch you think," he offers up serious insights and poignant stories. You'll laugh, you may cry, and as a communicator you'll certainly learn the importance of not only knowing how to fulfill, but also how to arouse.</p><p>Randy Olson earned his Ph.D. at Harvard University and became a professor of marine biology before moving to Hollywood for his second career as a filmmaker. Since obtaining an M.F.A. from the University of Southern California School of Cinema, he has written and directed the critically acclaimed films <i>Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus</i> (Tribeca, &#x2018;06, Showtime) and <i>Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy</i> (Outfest, &#x2019;08), and co-founded The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project, a partnership between scientists and Hollywood to communicate the crisis facing our oceans.In 1997, marine biologist Olson recognized that scientists needed better communications skills to address a growing backlash against "rational data-based science." Inspired by the "power of video," Olson gave up a tenured professorship and went to Hollywood to reach a broader audience through filmmaking. The crucial lesson he learned was how to tell a good story, a largely absent concern for scientists, who focus on accuracy rather than audience engagement. It was a lesson Olson learned the hard way, after his intelligent design documentary, Flock of Dodos, flopped for lack of a lively story line. By "starting with a quirky little tidbit" about his mother and the intelligent design lawyer she lives next to, Olson found the hook he was missing. Olson values motivation over education, looking to Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth ("the most important and best-made piece of environmental media in history") for a hugely successful example of his principles in action. As if to prove all he's learned, Olson packs this highly entertaining book with more good stories than good advice, spurring readers to rethink their personal communication styles rather than ape Olson's example. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book does not break new ground, despite its aspirations, but it's well worth a look. Among the best stories: Peter Straub's "Blue Rose," about a disturbed youth whose violence finds its inevitable expression in the insanity of Vietnam; Joe Haldeman's account of another Viet vet, "The Monster," whose ability to adopt different personalities gets out of control in a spectacular manner; George Clayton Johnson's "The Man with a Hoe," a tale of the worm turning, with a vengeance; Ramsey Campbell's almost unbearably claustrophobic chiller of a traveling book salesman who wanders into a particularly loathsome Hell; Charles L. Grant's "Out There," which tells of a man who has drawn the web of his life so tightly it cuts him when he tries to break free; and Clive Barker's horror-detective story, "Lost Souls," an unusually restrained tale for this author.

Readers embraced his precise, sad, often funny and poignant tales of ordinary people and their troubles: poverty, drunkenness, embittered marriages, difficulties brought on by neglect rather than intent.

She attended college in San Luis Obispo and taught high school in Oxnard before completing a Ph.D. at Washington University in St. Louis. She has published short stories, essays, and a study of D. H. Lawrence. She lives with her husband, poet R.M. Ryan, near the Russian River in California.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Introduction <br> <blockquote> We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.<br> -- epigraph to Raymond Carver's <i>Where I'm Calling From,</i><br> quoted from Milan Kundera's <i>The Unbearable</i><br> <i>Lightness of Being</i> </blockquote> <br> <br> <p> Few American short story writers have been celebrated as Raymond Carver was in the 1980s. Because his spare, colloquial prose hints at something absent and mysterious, critics called him the father of minimalist fiction. Writers and writing teachers revered and imitated his style. Readers loved his grim, often funny, sometimes transcendent stories about the lives of the working poor. He wrote about their money problems, alcoholism, embittered marriages, and disaffected children; about muted, interior crises brought on by bad luck or neglect rather than intent. Carver knew that territory because he lived in it for much of his life. </p><p> Carver paid a high price for the experiences that served his art. <br> </p><p> When printer's galleys arrived for his first book of short stories, <i>Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?,</i> Carver and his wife, who was a schoolteacher, had just been released from their debts by a federal bankruptcy court. Carver drank vodka while he corrected the pages at his dining room table in Cupertino, California. </p><p> On the day after the book's publication in March 1976, two of Carver's friends arrived at his house early in the morning. They didn't come to celebrate the book that would become a National Book Award finalist. They came to drive him and his wife to his trial at the county courthouse; he had been charged with lying to obtain unemployment payments. As they all departed, Maryann Carver took a shiny, white book from a stack on their table. The book was dedicated to her, a fruit of their nineteen married years. She would show it to the judge as evidence that her husband was still a man with prospects. She hoped to be able to keep him out of jail. She would explain that he was the victim of unfulfilled dreams and alcoholism. </p><p> Indeed, <i>Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?</i> was a career-launching book. Carver, then thirty-eight, had published in literary magazines -- plus two stories in <i>Esquire</i> -- but this first book had been a long time coming. </p><p> It came almost too late. <br> </p><p> Alcohol had ruled Carver's life for longer than he cared to admit. Lying to the state of California was hardly the worst offense Carver had committed as he capitulated to late-stage alcoholism. "Everything," he wrote later, that he and Maryann "held sacred, every spiritual value, [had] crumbled away." </p><p> Carver's fate had closed in on him when he suffered an alcoholic withdrawal seizure in the lobby of a clinic where he'd just been detoxified. A doctor told him then that he'd risk irreversible brain damage if he drank again; that first book could be his last. Despite the dire warning, Carver continued to drink, detox, and relapse for another two years. As he became sicker and sicker, he hid the severity of his problem more cunningly from everyone but his family and close friends. These people worried, but they couldn't influence him. </p><p> Yet Carver finally turned his life around, becoming one of the rare exceptions in a long line of hopelessly alcoholic American authors. When he finally quit drinking, he made the decision alone. That day of his last drink was the natal day of his new life, the beginning of the decade he described as "gravy" -- the sauce that enriches an ordinary meal. </p><p> In his eleven sober years, Carver made difficult decisions that changed his work and his circumstances. He relished the rewards, affection, and freedom that came his way. When he died in 1988, <i>Where I'm Calling From,</i> a selection of his short stories that the <i>New York Times</i> named a favorite book of the late twentieth century, had just been published; he had just completed his third collection of poetry in five years. His work appeared in twenty-two languages and the <i>Times</i> of London called him "the American Chekhov." He was a full-time writer, acclaimed by the press and supported by royalties from his books and a generous five-year grant from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. </p><p> In the end, though, Carver measured his own success by what he'd come through and by the work that he believed would survive him. He wasn't a saint, and his sobriety wasn't perfect -- he remained a nervous, obsessive, and lovably boyish man addicted to cigarettes and reliant on marijuana. But he credited his productive final years to not drinking: "I'm prouder of that, that I've quit drinking, than I am of anything in my life." </p><p> Carver liked to say he had two lives, and sometimes he spoke of two people, Bad Ray and Good Ray, viewing himself with the bemused, kindly detachment he held for his fictional characters. Of course, he was one man with one life. Bad Ray and Good Ray together were messier and more human than his dichotomy supposed. </p><p> Carver acknowledged the irrevocable singleness of his life when he selected as an epigraph to his final volume of stories a quotation from Milan Kundera that speaks of the impossibility of knowing "what to want" or of perfecting oneself within one lifetime. Carver became a more confident and luckier man when he stopped drinking, but he didn't become a different man. In recovery, he accepted himself and marveled at his own achievements. His intention to write well remained his true north. </p><p> Copyright ï¿½ 2009 by Carol Sklenicka</p></p><h2>The Best American Science And Nature Writing 2013</h2><p>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author&nbsp;Siddhartha Mukherjee, a leading cancer physician and researcher,&nbsp;selects the year&#x2019;s&nbsp;top science and nature writing from&nbsp;journalists who dive into their fields with curiosity and passion, delivering&nbsp;must-read articles&nbsp;from a wide array of fields.</p><p>The Best American Seriesï¿½<br>First, Best, and Best-Selling<br><br>The Best American series is the premier annual showcase for the country&#x2019;s finest short fiction and nonfiction.

Now an expert on arcane symbolism uncovers the fascinating secret meanings behind the design of the money we use every day.</p><p> In <em>The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill,</em> David Ovason explores the visual complexity and magic behind the world's most influential currency. Ovason contends that some of the Great Seal's symbols represent the principles of the young republic and that their origins were obscured over time. The dollar bill was more than just currency for our country -- it was structured in such a way to demonstrate the nation's place in the world and the classical roots of its fight for freedom.</p><p>Presented in a simple format and written with Ovason's trademark lively style, the book invites readers to take up a dollar bill and set off on a visual adventure. Readers will encounter dazzling explanations of the dollar bill's secret contents, from the symbols derived from the Great Seal through the extraordinary strands of numerology interwoven into its structure to surprising hidden alignments.</p><p>David Ovason is a recognized authority in the field of arcane symbolism. His research into the dollar bill reveals hidden biblical and classical references, as well as symbols derived from such societies as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons, both of which engage in esoteric thought. So reach into your wallet and prepare for a history lesson unlike any other.</p></p><p><p>David Ovason has spent more than a decade researching the architecture and zodiacs of Washington, D.C.

He &#34;received&#34; a series of poems about which he did not speak for a long time - he considered them sacred, and different from anything else he ever had done and ever would do again. This poet saw the coming darkness of the century, and saw the struggle we would have in our relationship to the divine. The poet was Rainer Maria Rilke, and these love poems to God make up his Book of Hours.Anita Barrows, a prize-winning poet and a clinical psychologist, is the author of four books of her own poetry and the recipient of an NEA grant as well as the <i>Quarterly Review of Literature</i>'s Contemporary Poetry Award.

Complete with charts covering daily, monthly, and annual routines and care, information on transporting and showing your horse, and explanations of how the natural behavior of horses can help you understand your own horse&#39;s behavior, The Complete Horse Care Manual provides all the information and the insights you need to keep you horse healthy and fit.</p><p>Colin Vogel, B.V.M., M.R.C.V.S., is a well--known and highly respected veterinary surgeon who practices in England. He specializes in horse care and has written many books and articles on all aspects of horses and their health.New and prospective horse owners will welcome the publication of this high-quality book, which contains a wealth of information and is well organized and clearly presented, at a very reasonable price. Excellent color photographs and drawings accompany the text, written by a veterinary surgeon who practices in England and specializes in horse care. Topics discussed include basic care, daily routines, stabling, grooming, feeding, health, first aid, and types of tack and care. The chapters on horse disorders and diseases, accompanied by many helpful charts and illustrations, are especially useful. Since this is specifically a horse care manual, the book does not address riding techniques or the various horse breeds. All the photographs are British, a drawback for those who prefer the Western style of riding, as there is only one photo of a piece of Western equipment. But this does not detract from the book's informative value. Recommended, especially for public libraries with popular equine collections.<br><i>Deborah Emerson, Monroe Community Coll.

Her father has returned from the Iraq war as an amputee with posttraumatic stress disorder, and his nightmares rock the household. At the stable, Hannah comes to love Jack, Super Dee, and Indy; helps bring a rescued mare back from the brink; and witnesses the birth of the filly who steals her heart. Hannah learns more than she ever imagined about horse training, abuse, and rescues, as well as her own capacity for hope. Physical therapy with horses could be the answer to her fatherï¿½s prayers, if only she can get him to try.</p><p>Young Adult novelist,<b> Ginny Rorby, </b>is the author of<b> <i>Dolphin Sky</i></b>, (Putnam, '96) <b><i>Hurt Go Happy</i>,</b> (Tor Books, '06) <b><i>The Outside of a Horse</i></b>, (Dial Books, '10) and <b><i>Lost in the River of Grass</i></b>, (Lerner Books, March '11) <b><i>Dolphin Sky</i></b> was nominated for the Keystone Reading Award. <b><i>Hurt Go Happy</i></b> was a Junior Library Guild, a Scholastic Book Fair selection, has been nominated for reading awards in six states and won the ALA's 2008 Schneider Family Book award. <b><i>The Outside of a Horse</i></b> is a Scholastic Book Fair selection, and <b><i>Lost in the River of Grass</i></b> is a Junior Library Guild selection, a Scholastic Book Fair selection, and has just been nominated for the Sunshine State Reading award. <br> &nbsp;<br> Ginny was raised in Winter Park, Florida, and lived in Miami during her career as a Pan American flight attendant. She holds an undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Miami, and an MFA in Creative Writing from Florida International University. Her goal, after wrapping up her flying career and her graduate studies, was to move someplace where she would never be hot again. She now lives on the chilly coast of northern California with her thirty-year-old parrot and way too many cats. Ginny is director emeritus of the Mendocino Coast Writers Conference and continues her involvement with this 23 year-old institution. She served as President of the Mendocino Coast Audubon Society for seven years, was on the board of the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens, is past president of the Point Cabrillo Lightkeeper's Association, and continues to serve on the PCLK board of directors.&nbsp;Grade 6-9 Hannah, 13, has always loved watching horse races on television with her father, but when she begins to help out at a local riding stable, she discovers how much more she enjoys working with real animals, especially those who have suffered abuse. She particularly loves a filly named Rega, the offspring of a Premarin mare (a pregnant horse from which urine is collected to make pharmaceuticals). When her dad returns from Iraq as an amputee suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Hannah's work at the stable not only helps her cope with the problems at home, but also leads her to equine-assisted psychotherapy and riding therapy for her troubled father. Things improve, but Hannah will need all her strength to make a difficult decision when Rega suffers a terrible injury. Like Rorby's <i>Hurt Go Happy</i> (Tor, 2006), this book is laden with so many issues the problems of returning vets, various and horrifying types of abuse of horses, humane Parelli horse training methods that they nearly overwhelm the story, and the horse/human amputee metaphor becomes heavy-handed. However, this novel really shines in showing how horses can help troubled humans heal their physical and emotional wounds. There's plenty of fodder here for spirited book discussions. <i>Kathleen E.

Yet, more and more, Christians are unfamiliar with the stories of the Bible and how the grand narrative of God's Word fits together. Indeed, God gave us the stories of the Bible to reveal great truth about Himself and about our lives, and He wants to draw us into the ongoing story of what He is doing in the world. By focusing on the narrative framework of Scripture we can better understand what the Bible teaches and live out its instruction more effectively.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Reading God's Story</i> takes that clear narrative approach to the Bible, arranging the complete text into a fresh chronological reading plan developed for the Read the Bible for Life biblical literacy initiative.

The book&#39;s whimsical illustrations, reminiscent of Beatrix Potter, glow with brilliant color and are filled with fascinating detail. Each number introduces a facet of traditional Native American culture, such as Pueblo corn dances or Navajo weaving, and the simple, rhyming text is enhanced by a brief afterword on Native American customs. Ideal for storytime or bedtime, this is a book sure to leave children counting rabbits instead of sheep.</p><p>This winner of the Parents Magazine "Best Book of the Year" award is a simple counting book that celebrates Native American culture--and rabbits, of course. Each of Sylvia Long's detailed, painterly double-page illustrations has an old-fashioned quality that gives the book the feel of classic children's literature from the turn of the century. The accompanying text is a simple, rhythmic series of rhyming couplets. "Three busy messengers sending out the news" has three rabbits using one of their blankets to send smoke signals across a grassy river valley; "Four clever trackers looking for some clues" shows intrepid little hunters with bows and arrows examining the enormous paw-print of a bear. After "Ten sleepy weavers knowing day is done," an extra panel shows one rabbit hunched over a campfire while the other nine sleep soundly. A cut above the mass of counting books.

A contemporary of Luther, an enemy of the medical establishment, a scourge of the universities, an alchemist, an army surgeon, and a radical theologian, he attracted myths even before he died. His fantastic journeys across Europe and beyond were said to be made on a magical white horse, and he was rumored to carry the elixir of life in the pommel of his great broadsword. His name was linked with Faust, who bargained with the devil.<br>Who was the man behind these stories? Some have accused him of being a charlatan, a windbag who filled his books with wild speculations and invented words. Others claim him as the father of modern medicine. Philip Ball exposes a more complex truth in <i>The Devil's Doctor</i>&#x2014;one that emerges only by entering into Paracelsus&#x2019;s time. He explores the intellectual, political, and religious undercurrents of the sixteenth century and looks at how doctors really practiced, at how people traveled, and at how wars were fought. For Paracelsus was a product of an age of change and strife, of renaissance and reformation. And yet by uniting the diverse disciplines of medicine, biology, and alchemy, he assisted, almost in spite of himself, in the birth of science and the emergence of the age of rationalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Philip Ball is the author of <i>Life&#x2019;s Matrix</i> (FSG, 2000), <i>Bright Earth</i> (FSG, 2002), and <i>Critical Mass</i> (FSG, 2004), which won the Aventis Science Book Prize in 2005.The Devil's Doctor<br>CHAPTER ONEBlack Madonna<i>A Country Doctor</i>&nbsp;<br><i>First there is the forest and inside the forest the clearing and inside the clearing the cabin and inside the cabin the mother and inside the mother the child and inside the child the mountain.</i><i>Paracelsus, physician, magician, alchemist, urge, demiurge, deus</i> et omnia <i>was born under the sign of the occult, ruled by Mars and driven by a mountain in his soul.</i>--Jeanette Winterson, <i>Gut Symmetries</i> (1997)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Every year on the fourteenth of September, it is as if the small Swiss town of Einsiedeln, in the canton of Schwyz, returns to the time when Paracelsus was born there. The town square, dominated by the vast Benedictine abbey, is dark but for thousands of candles flickering in glass pots from every wall and windowsill. As the moon rises above the wooded hill that overlooks the scene, the evening is scented with the resinous tang of incense. From out of the abbey comes a solemn procession of pilgrims, each with a flame in hand, led by priests robed in white and monks in their dark habits. The only incongruous element is a brass band in chocolate-box uniforms, lending the scene a touch of fairground baroque. It is the end of summer, and the night air grows chill. Outside, beyond the town, darkness gathers.The candle-carrying pilgrims who parade each year in Einsiedeln mark the annual celebration of the Miraculous Consecration. The first church and monastery were erected there in 948 by the wealthy Canon Eberhard of Strasbourg, but plans for their consecration byBishop Conrad of Constanz were preempted. On the eve of the ceremony, the bishop was astonished to find the chapel filled with a choir of angels, while the service was conducted by Christ Himself, assisted by St. Peter, St. Gregory the Great, and the Four Evangelists. Not trusting his own senses, and entreated by Eberhard and the Benedictine brothers to carry out the ceremony as had been planned, the bishop began the ritual the next day only to be halted by God's voice telling him that the place was already consecrated. Hearing Conrad's account, Pope Leo VIII forbade any subsequent attempt at consecration.Einsiedeln was already a site of pilgrimage when the abbey was built. But there had been nothing there except wild forest when, in the ninth century, the Benedictine monk Meinrad arrived from Bollingen on Lake Zï¿½rich. In a clearing by the River Sihl, Meinrad established a hermitage where he withdrew in 829 for a life of solitary contemplation. He took with him a Madonna and Child carved from hard black wood, a gift from Abbess Hildegarde of the convent on Lake Zurich. To house this statue Meinrad made a shrine, and the "Black Madonna" became known as Our Lady of Einsiedeln. The original figurine was destroyed by a fire, but a fifteenth-century copy still stands in a gilded case in the entrance to the abbey.As people began to seek out this ascetic hermit and ask for his blessing, the rumor spread that Meinrad had accumulated great wealth. One day brigands turned up at the lonely hut and cut down the monk, who greeted them mildly with an offer of food. But they searched in vain for treasure. According to legend, two ravens, witnessing the murder, flew to Zurich to raise the alarm, so that the thieves were caught and burned at the stake. Meinrad, martyred in 861, was subsequently canonized. Einsiedeln does not forget its founding legend, for the two black ravens are everywhere still today: on the town's coat of arms, on the Black Madonna's shrine, even on the logo for the local beer.By the fifteenth century the town had grown around the monastery, with a hospital where sick pilgrims were treated. Some time in the 1480s Paracelsus's father, a young medical graduate of the University of Tï¿½bingen named Wilhelm von Hohenheim, arrived in Einsiedeln and became physician for the town and hospital.FALLEN FROM GRACEWilhelm may have wandered this way more or less aimlessly from southern Germany, without money and lacking even the formal qualification of a doctor, for he did not complete his postgraduate studies at Tï¿½bingen. Although the family name von Hohenheim implied nobility, his father Georg had been disgraced and became impoverished, and moreover Wilhelm was illegitimate and had been raised on his uncle's farm in the village of Rieth in Wï¿½rttemberg.Hohenheim Castle stood near Stuttgart in Swabia, and it was the seat (the name means "mountain home") of Conrad Bombast, who died in 1299. Conrad was a soldier and a feudal tenant of the count of Wï¿½rttemberg, with claim to the tithes of the villagers of Plieningen and Ober-Esslingen. But by the time Georg rode as a commander of the Teutonic Knights on a crusade to the Holy Land in 1468, the fortunes of the Bombasts were in decline. They had farther yet to fall.Bombast, an old Swabian name, has inevitably given rise to the idea that Paracelsus's bluster and arrogance lie at the root of the word "bombastic." One feels that ought to be so, but it is not. <i>Baum</i> means "tree" in German (in the Swabian dialect it is rendered <i>Bom</i>), and <i>Baumbast</i> is the fibrous layer of a tree's bark. But in the sixteenth century "bombast" had also come to mean cotton padding, inappropriately derived from <i>bombax</i>, the medieval Latin name for the silkworm, and it is from this origin that the connotation of puffed up derives. The family line of the Bombasts von Hohenheim ended in 1574, but there were still Bombasts in Wï¿½rttemberg in the nineteenth century.The story of Ritter (knight) Georg Bombast von Hohenheim has something of a Paracelsian tenor, for he was a man toppled from his position of power by his own ungovernable impulses. He fathered Wilhelm in 1457 by an unnamed mistress--no great embarrassment for its time, although disadvantageous for Wilhelm--and Georg came to hold high rank with the Order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem.In 1489 Georg became embroiled in a bitter political argument in Stuttgart, and his fierce tongue caused him to be summoned before the High Court of Justice, which decreed that Georg's estate (such asit was) was forfeit. Thereafter the disgraced von Hohenheims were a family of paltry means and little consequence. It may have been his father's downfall that set Wilhelm on his travels south. Others say that his arrival in Einsiedeln was no happenstance, but that he was summoned there from Wï¿½rttemberg to take up his position as town physician in 1481.A COUNTRY DOCTORThere is a woodcut of Einsiedeln from 1577 that shows the abbey lodged on a hill beneath forests that climb up the mountainside. A cluster of houses is scattered farther down the slopes, and the road winding up to the abbey from the valley floor is busy with pilgrims on foot and on horse. Down a ravine, steepened by artistic license, tumbles the torrent of the Sihl, and the water is straddled at one point by the wooden Teï¿½felsbrï¿½cke, the Devil's Bridge. Beside this bridge is a sturdy building, somewhat larger than the humble lodgings of the town, and this, one assumes, is the inn where a footsore Wilhelm rested after his long journey.The inn, set in green hills about three miles from the town, was run by the family of Rudi Ochsner. It stood on ground owned by the abbey, to which the Ochsners were feudally bound. Behind the inn, cattle graze in gently undulating meadows--but the hierarchy of the picture is clear enough, with the abbey dominating the vista like a lord's castle. The inn stood until the nineteenth century, when it was burned down.Today there is another tavern in its place, an undistinguished brick building that proudly displays a plaque claiming that it is the birthplace of Theophrastus von Hohenheim, known as Paracelsus. That claim is almost certainly false, but his real homestead was indeed somewhere in these meadows, now vanished and forgotten, and the Devil's Bridge seems as good a place as any to begin his story.At the beginning, however, there is little but legend, rumor, and sheer speculation. You can tell this part of the tale any way you will, and many have done so. One version has it that the innkeeper's daughter was named Els, a matron in the pilgrim hospital. Wilhelm made the inn his home as the local doctor, and in 1491 he married Els. But other sources suggest that Els was Rudi's wife, not Wilhelm's. Paracelsus's mother has been variously identified as a member of the Grï¿½tzel family, who owned the house in which the Hohenheims lived, and as one of the Weseners of Einsiedeln. Whatever her name, Wilhelm's wife may have been no matron at all but merely a bondswoman to the abbey: this is all that might be implied by the sole remaining description of her status as a "woman of the house of God."Nonetheless, the occasion of Wilhelm's marriage is purportedly recorded in a portrait painted the same year, in which he holds a carnation as a sign of betrothal. Whether this picture does indeed represent Wilhelm von Hohenheim has been disputed, but it now supplies the basis for several commemorative portraits of Paracelsus's father. Dressed soberly in black, he looks calmly out of a window at a rocky vista much like that visible from the inn at the Devil's Bridge. In the top right-hand corner of the picture are the arms of the von Hohenheims: three azure globes on a bend argent. In the opposite corner is the heraldic head of an ox, possibly a reference to his bride's family name.If it is truly the father, this image seems that of a man with a temperament very different from his son's: by all accounts a gentle, patientman, whose years of study gave him a good working knowledge of Latin, botany, medicine, alchemy, and theology. Paracelsus worshipped Wilhelm, calling him his first teacher, "who has never forsaken me."1 Never one to feel bound by obligation, his visits to his father at Villach in later life were presumably made more out of genuine love than filial duty.In 1493 Wilhelm and his wife had a son, whom they christened Theophrastus, although this was often prefixed by the name of his name-day saint: Philip. The Greek Christian name was an unusual choice for a German and reveals Wilhelm's love of Classical learning. Tyrtamos of Eresos (c. 372-288 B.C.), known as Theophrastus, was a pupil of Aristotle and succeeded him as head of the Lyceum in Athens. He inherited Aristotle's passion for natural history, but whereas his teacher had written mostly on the animal kingdom, Theophrastus compiled encyclopedic treatises on plants and minerals. His book <i>De lapida</i> (<i>On Stones</i>), written around 300 B.C., is a comprehensive study of minerals and represents perhaps the earliest known work on practical chemistry. Benefiting from knowledge that Theophrastus gathered through his interest in mining, the book is a forerunner of the great <i>De re metallica</i> by the German humanist Georgius Agricola. In retrospect, Wilhelm could hardly have chosen a better model for his son.Who, really, was Wilhelm's wife? The paucity of information has driven some biographers to absurd extremes of ingenuity and invention: Josef Strebel's compilation of Paracelsus's works from 1944 attemptsto suggest what she may have looked like by adding a head scarf to a portrait of Paracelsus himself. Paracelsus extols the virtues of his father, but about his mother he is silent. It has been inferred that she was a manic-depressive, and certainly, Paracelsus wrote about mental illnesses with a sensitivity most uncharacteristic of his time. According to one legend, when Theophrastus was nine years old his mother walked onto the Devil's Bridge and threw herself over the parapet into the Sihl. But all we really know is that by 1502 she was dead.In Paracelsus's time, very few children reached adulthood without experiencing death in the family. Parents expected to lose children to illness or mishap, often at birth, while the plague and other endemic fatal illnesses left countless children orphaned. Violence and murder were commonplace. But the suicide of a young boy's mother, if it really happened, would even then have had a shattering impact on the child. It is risky to speculate about the psychological consequences, but if anyone is to be permitted to do so, it might be Carl Jung, who says of Paracelsus's mother,She died young, and she probably left behind a great deal of unsatisfied longing in her son--so much so that, as far as we know, no other woman was able to compete with that far distant mother-image, which for that reason was all the more formidable. The more remote and unreal the personal mother is, the more deeply will the son's yearning for her clutch at his soul, awakening that primordial and eternal image of the mother for whose sake everything that embraces, protects, nourishes, and helps assumes maternal form ... When Paracelsus says that the mother of the child is the planet and star, this is in the highest degree true of himself.2Jung claims that Paracelsus found two substitute mothers in his life: the church and Mother Nature. The agony of it was that these two were not always concordant, although Paracelsus labored mightily to resolve the conflict.As a child, Theophrastus von Hohenheim was small and frail. Despite his close relationship to his father, he recalled that "I grew up in great misery"3 because the poor wages of a country doctor made for a straitened existence. He suffered from rickets, a softening of the bones caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, often the result of a lack of eggs and milk inthe diet. This disease produces skeletal deformities including an enlargement of the upper head, and it has been proposed as the reason for the curious squarish profile of the balding pate evident in the portrait of Paracelsus made near the end of his life (see here). His skull was disinterred from his grave in Salzburg in the nineteenth century and inspected by an anatomist who confirmed this diagnosis.It was an indelicate upbringing, which Paracelsus celebrated defiantly later in his life:By nature I am not subtly spun, nor is it the custom of my native land to accomplish anything by spinning silk. Nor are we raised on figs, nor on mead, nor on wheaten bread, but on cheese, milk, and oatcakes, which cannot give one a subtle disposition. Moreover, a man clings all his days to what he received in his youth; and my youth was coarse as compared to that of the subtle, pampered, and overrefined. For those who are raised in soft clothes and in women's apartments and we who are brought up among the pine-cones have trouble in understanding one another well. To begin with, I thank God that I was born a German, and praise Him for having made me suffer poverty and hunger in my youth.4This pride in simplicity, even coarseness, was perhaps characteristically German. (When Paracelsus thanks God for his German heritage, he obviously means this to be a label of culture rather than nationality. But when his reputation waxed in the late nineteenth century, the modern state of Germany was eager to claim him as one of its own--for after all, his was a noble family of Swabia, however low they had fallen. He is lionized there still today, where many streets and public places are named in his honor.) In 1590 the Italian painter Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo could have been describing Paracelsus when he advised artists how the German race should be portrayed: with a "strutting stride, extravagant gesture, wild expression, clothing all anyhow, manner hard and stern."5</p><h2>The Wild Shores: America&#39;s Beginnings</h2><p>To the wild and unknown shores of a new world, hesitantly at first, then with growing expectations, came Europe&#39;s adventurers and dispossessed, saints and sinners, farmers and traders, poor hoping to get rich, and rich hoping to get richer.

Remainder mark bottom edge.</p><p>While the British Regency lasted only from 1811 to 1820, the Regency style developed over half a century. The author identifies thematic influences on gardens, buildings, interior decoration, and furniture that characterized the fashion choices of both the upper and the emerging commercial middle class. Among these influences, Morley highlights the arts of Greece and Rome, the grandeur of medieval cathedrals, the mystery of the Orient, as well as late 18th-century aesthetic theories. He chronicles a time when enthusiastic new combinations of old forms ended in sometimes gracious, sometimes outrageous results. While spanning the entire "growth, maturity, and decadence of a distinct style," Morley paints a broad canvas with an elegant brush, dipping here into primary sources, there into original plans and illustrations. Lavish and stylish in keeping with its subject matter, this is an excellent survey of the artistic, intellectual, and social relationships that shaped a generation. Recommended for all art libraries and larger general collections.<br><i>- Paula Frosch, Metropolitan Museum of Art Lib., New York</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.England's Regency style, exemplified by Windsor Castle's sumptuous interiors and the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, an exotic amalgam of Chinese, Indian and neoclassical motifs, reached its peak of hedonistic refinement during the reign of George IV (1811-1830). In this thorough, lavishly illustrated study, Morley, a former keeper at the Victoria and Albert Museum, presents Regency as an enchanting, if autumnal, style, a humane haven from the encroaching uglification of the Industrial Revolution. From simple cottages to soothing gardens to neo-Gothic castles, Regnecy evolved in a dizzying succession of design modes: Etruscan, Pompeian, "archeological," rococo, antiquarian and so forth. Morley clearly differentiates these often intertwined styles, aided by hundreds of reproductions of prints, watercolors, engravings, paintings and plans. Fragmented modern people may well envy the sense of luxuriant calm and order emanating from these appealing Regency buildings, interiors and landscapes. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Claude Monet: Water Lilies</h2><p>Claude Monet (1840-1926) devoted the last 25 years of his career to paintings of the Japanese-style pond and gardens of his house in Giverny, France. Two of these luminous panels--&#34;Reflections of Clouds on the Water-Lily Pond,&#34; a mural-sized triptych, and &#34;Water Lilies,&#34; a single canvas--are among the most well-known and beloved works in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art. The aim of these paintings, according to the artist, was to supply &#34;the illusion of an endless whole, of water without horizon or bank.&#34; These late works were for many years less appreciated than Monet&#39;s classic Impressionist works, oftentimes seen as unstructured, even unfinished. But with the emergence of Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s, Monet became an extraordinarily relevant predecessor. In 1955, The Museum of Modern Art became the first American museum to acquire one of Monet&#39;s large-scale water lily compositions. In 1958, when a fire destroyed this and another water lily painting, the public&#39;s widespread expression of loss led to the acquisition of the works currently in the collection. This lively volume recounts the history of Monet&#39;s water lilies at the Museum underscores the resonance of these paintings with the art and artists of the last half-century.</p><p>&#34;Encapsulates Monet&#39;s career and zeroes in on the late paintings and their importance in accessible layman&#39;s terms.

The Southern commanders who faced Grant, Sherman and Sheridan in these campaigns were of varied backgrounds and talents: some had been sent West in disfavour, others were foolishly quarrelsome, and after A.S.Johnston&#39;s death at Shiloh there was no single figure with the authority to dominate them. Some were nevertheless of the highest class: men like Joseph E.Johnston, the cavalry leader Nathan Bedford Forrest, and the little known Patrick Cleburne and Alexander Stewart earned ungrudging respect.

Hagman lives in Seattle.</p>Gluten-Free Gourmet Makes Dessert<br><i>The Gluten-free Lifestyle</i><i>A</i>ctually this is a chapter about the gluten-free diet and how to live it. If you think of it as a lifestyle and not a diet, it may not sound so dire.Diets are rigid; our lifestyle as a celiac can be anything we make it. If we look at the bright side, we can now make or buy almost anything we crave to eat; the downside is that we have to plan ahead for our meals whether at home or eating out. And we are going to spend more time ordering food by mail, shopping at health food stores, or cooking.When my doctor's nurse handed me two crumpled, mimeographed sheets instead of a prescription when I was diagnosed, I figured this was going to be easy. When I carried the sheets into the grocery on my way home, I received the same shock you probably did--there was nothing on the dry cereal shelf that didn't contain gluten. And naturally the breads, cookies, and crackers were off-limits--as were the pancake and waffle mixes. I went home with rice cakes and jam. After a few of those for breakfast, it didn't take me long to figure out a way of making muffins from some of the gluten-free flours.That was my approach to the diet--don't let it intimidate you!There's a lot to learn. What foods contain gluten? Where can I shop? What happens if I get some gluten? How long do I have to be on the diet?Let's start with the last. This will have to be a lifetime change, or until the scientists who are working on the problem either find a vaccine or learn to genetically changeour faulty immune systems, or the cereal chemists create a wheat without the gliadin fraction of the gluten that irritates our guts.As for the foods that contain gluten, that's much harder to answer. It's simple to recognize that most of the breads, cakes, cookies, and crackers on the grocery shelf are made with (wheat) flour. For many it's hard to remember that pastas and the batters on fried foods are also. But not many of us realized when we first read the list that our biggest problem would not be the obvious but the hidden glutens that go into the ingredient lists of soups, custards, ice creams, and so on as modified food starch, which can be potato, corn, tapioca, or wheat.If you're starting to panic, hold it!Don't expect to learn it all at once. Start with the basics. Eliminate the obvious wheat products and substitute gluten-free ones either from your own baking or purchased from mail-order suppliers or health food stores. Remember: you can have any plain fruit or vegetable and plain cuts of any meat. (You'll have to read labels on blended meats such as hot dogs and sausages and avoid turkey or ham that has been injected with HVP [hydrolyzed vegetable protein]).In time, you'll learn to question the pharmacist to see if your prescriptions or over-the-counter drugs contain gluten, and you may question such things as vitamins, toothpaste, and mouthwash.But, relax. No one can learn it all the first day.I realize that it sounds frightening to have to change a way of living if you're used to picking up a doughnut on your way to work and grabbing a sandwich for lunch. The new gluten-free muffins replaced the doughnut for me, and salads took the place of sandwiches until xanthan gum was introduced and I learned to make bread. It's sandwiches for lunch for me again.Now there are plenty of recipes, muffin mixes you can order, and even ready-baked muffins, cinnamon rolls, and other breakfast breads, as long as you're willing to order ahead and keep your freezer full. I told you it takes planning.Once you have mastered the basics and know you are eating gluten free, you should be free of the symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, irritable bowel, mental haze, or just lethargy) that led you to the doctor and diagnosis. If you are not, it's time to look for either contamination somewhere in your food or note other sensitivities or allergies you may have.Let's take contamination first. One of the major sources of contamination is in the home itself. A toaster may sprinkle crumbs from the wheat bread to yours. The kidsmixing up their pancakes will pollute the air and workplaces with wheat dust that can linger for twenty-four hours or until wiped up. If possible, to avoid the latter, it's sensible to bake gluten free for the whole family. This doesn't mean you have to deprive them of their own favorite gluten-filled cereal or bread. These can be purchased and don't shed gluten into the air; you can also buy their cookies and cakes rather than contaminating your kitchen. But you may find, as many do, that the gluten-free desserts in this book will be enjoyed by the entire family. And most celiacs who cook for their family try as much as possible to make the main dishes, side dishes and vegetables gluten free so only one meal has to be cooked. Now that we have great pastas to make or buy, the Four Flour Mix for a breading that's better than wheat flour, and GF Mix for thickening gravies and soup, it's easy to tempt the others into joining the celiac in this healthy lifestyle.Other sources of contamination can be in the way the gluten-free flours are marketed. Open bins in a health food store may be contaminated by customers unthinkingly using wrong scoops or returning unwanted flour to a wrong bin, thus mixing gluten flours with gluten-free ones. To avoid this, try to buy all your flours prepackaged.Now for sensitivities and allergies: This is a whole new can of worms. Remember when I said I had apple pie and coffee cake cravings? When I baked my first gluten-free apple pie, I knew the crumbly crust needed more work, but I never realized that the pie would bring on my old celiac symptoms. I thought that my flour was contaminated so I made another pie with newly purchased flours. Again the stomach distress! I tried eating cooked apples without the crust. Same symptoms!I discovered that I am sensitive to apples. Since apples contain aspartame, one of the ingredients in diet sodas, I realized why I couldn't tolerate diet soda and, now, apples.This was a plus for me--to know another of my sensitivities. I already had and continue to have intolerance to all dairy products (lactose, whey, casein), so I added apples and aspartame to my sensitivities list--and discovered that, alarmingly, almost all mixed-fruit drinks have an apple juice base. No mixed-fruit drinks for me. Warning: If you, too, find an allergy to a common food, remember to check ingredient lists for all forms of this food as well as gluten. No, these foods do not damage the gut as gluten does, but no one wants to be sick when they can avoid it.Once they've eliminated gluten, others find sensitivities to simple things like chocolate, eggs, nuts, soy, oranges, potatoes, and many other foods. I've heard of somewho cannot tolerate rice. So don't blame all your upsets on "gluten poisoning." It's not uncommon for celiacs, with their already sensitive gut, to find other allergies. Recognizing them will save you from embarrassment by crying "Gluten! gluten!" only to be proven that you've cried out falsely.Living gluten free will, at times, be frustrating (like having to order a hamburger "without the bun" when you'd rather dig into the featured pasta entree), annoying (trying to explain that you have a condition that limits your choice of food), or downright embarrassing (refusing that cookie your best friend baked). But the good health that results will offset these infrequent occasions. Don't compromise this by cheating.You certainly will feel like it and, at times, it would be far easier. But in the long run you will have to pay for the cheating. Your symptoms will return, and the effect of constant irritation to the small intestine every time you cheat can, in the end, damage your health. It has been shown that a celiac who stays gluten free over a period of five years has reduced the chance of cancer of the small bowel to that of someone without celiac disease. Who wants to gamble on cancer when you can help to avoid it? Other complications of long-term damage can be osteoporosis or pancreatic insufficiency, or both.Naturally, you may not always be able to avoid accidents. My very worst was when a kitchen helper added some imitation crab (made with wheat) to my fresh crab salad because "We'd run out of real crab and the salad looked skimpy." If you have an accident, treat it as such and figure you've learned a lesson. I did. I now ask several times if all the crab is "real."Accidents are accidents but cheating should be unforgivable.It's not easy, is it? But there are several ways we can make this new lifestyle as easy as possible.1. To save time and trouble, try to make as much of the meal gluten free as possible. The celiac will appreciate not feeling different and the cook will not have to make two meals. And there will be less risk of contamination. Using gluten-free condiments is one easy and painless way. Using the GF Mix for thickening and gravies is another. Many casseroles and main dishes can easily be converted to being gluten free. And, definitely, gluten-free desserts, as I've shown in this book, will please anyone. That is--if the celiac will share.2. Learn to bake. There are now many gluten-free main dishes and treats that can be ordered, as well as mixes for breads, cakes, cookies, and pizza crusts. Butthese take time and trouble to order. You can buy a few in health food stores, and some even in our regular groceries.But even more and better breads and desserts can be made from scratch at home. And they are far less expensive. One of the best perfumes in the world is the scent of fresh baked bread filling the house.3. Make good use of your freezer. Always have some treats frozen so the celiac will not feel deprived when others are eating a gluten-filled dessert. Freeze single portions of main dishes for the time the family dinner is off limits to the celiac. Mark these with large letters: GF. Or buy red dot stickers to warn others that the package is reserved for the celiac.4. Get into the habit of carrying some bagged treat in your purse or pocket for emergencies. A small plastic bag of Fritos along with coffee or a soda might get a celiac through the noon hour. Cookies or a granola bar can be eaten on a bus ride or tour. And always carry something for a celiac child who can't wait to get home to eat.As I go into my twenty-seventh year living gluten free I'm thankful for my diagnosis and the years of active good health it has given me. I hope you, too, will feel the same and consider this diet not a restriction but the beginning of a new, healthy lifestyle.It's almost impossible to write a gluten-free diet that will suit everyone because of the many sensitivities, preferences, and lifestyles. There has been much discussion among the various celiac groups in the United States about certain foods such as distilled grain alcohols and vinegars and natural flavorings. I've added the controversial grains of amaranth, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, and teff, which have always been allowed in Canada. There is also a difference between the zero tolerance allowed in the United States, Canada, and Australia to that of most European countries (.003). In the following pages I've simply listed the foods that are gluten free and those that aren't according to the diet list compiled in 2000 by two of the groups in the United States and representatives of the Canadian Dietetic Association and the Canadian Celiac Association, which was later published in the American Dietetic Association Diet Manual.If you feel that any items I've listed as acceptable in this list are not for your diet, don't hesitate to leave them out. Our diet is a judgment choice and we are free to make it using the best and latest information we have.Copyright ï¿½ 2002 by Bette Hagman</p><h2>The Last Thirteen: 9 (Book 5)</h2><p>Juvenile Fiction recommended for Ages 10 to 15.

Books about the business of fatherhood and the trials of sonhood are very rare, and this is a fine one."<br>--Boston Globe<br><br>John Bartram was the greatest horticulturist and botanist of eighteenth-century America, a farmer-philosopher who won the patronage of King George III and Benjamin Franklin. His son William was a pioneering naturalist who documented his travels through the Florida wilderness in prose and drawings that inspired a generation of Romantic poets. In telling their stories, Thomas Slaughter creates a complex and compelling dual biography that is also a history of early American attitudes toward nature. <br><br>As he follows the Bartrams through their respective careers--and through the tenderness and disappointment of the father-son relationship--Slaughter examines the ways in which each viewed the natural world: as a resource to be exploited, as evidence of divine providence, as a temple in which all life was interconnected and sacred. The Natures of John and William Bartram is a major work of natural and human history--beautifully written, psychologically insightful, and full of provocative ideas concerning the place of nature in the imagination of Americans, past and present.<br><br>"A fascinating page-turner that should not be missed. "&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>--Michael Kammen, Cornell University</p><p>John Bartram (1699-1777), &#34;the first native-born American to devote his entire life to the study of nature,&#34; was an eminently practical man, a scientist devoted to the rigorous description of living things. Among his subjects was the Venus flytrap, along with hundreds of species of plants and animals, fully &#34;one quarter of all the plants identified and sent to Europe during the colonial period.&#34; His son William (1739-1823) was, by contrast, something of a dreamer, and far less methodical a scientist than was his father. Yet his lyrical Travels, an account of specimen-collecting in the Deep South, is read today, while John Bartram&#39;s work is not. Thomas Slaughter examines their lives, noting the influence both men had on Henry David Thoreau and the English Romantics, especially Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth.<b>Thomas P.

He is editor of <i>William Bartram: Travels and Other Writings</i> and author of <i>Exploring Lewis and Clark</i> and <i>Apostle of Abolition: A Spiritual Biography of John Woolman</i>.</p><h2>Dangerous Muse: The Life of Lady Caroline Blackwood</h2><p>Caroline Blackwood was born into the Guinness family in 1931, the daughter of the Fourth Marquess and Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava. Brought up on the ancestral estate in Northern Ireland, Blackwood moved easily among the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, the Soho bohemians of postwar England, and the liberal intelligentsia of 1960s New York. She was on intimate terms with some of the most celebrated artists and writers of her time. An unpredictable beauty known for her wit and her courage, she has been called a muse to genius. But her marriages to three brilliant men: the painter Lucian Freud, the composer Israel Citkowitz, <br>and the poet Robert Lowell were as troubled as they were inspiring.<br><br>During her marriage to Lucian Freud, Caroline became part of an artistic and literary group that included Francis Bacon and Cyril Connolly who was infatuated with her but eventually Freud's gambling caused irrevocable problems between them. Caroline was also in the grips of her own unfolding tragedy: a fatal attraction to alcohol that would plague the rest of her life.<br><br>Upon the breakup of her first marriage, she moved to America , where she met her second and third husbands. Once regarded as the obvious successor to Aaron Copland, Israel Citkowitz had stopped composing long before he met Caroline. While he and Caroline had three children together, it was her subsequent seven year marriage to Robert Lowell that she considered her "main marriage." Her life with Lowell was probably the most difficult time of her life as she dealt with his increasingly frequent and worsening attacks of mania. And to Lowell she was not only an inspiration but_as he described in his Pulitzer-prize- winning book of verse <b>The Dolphin</b>, she was also "a mermaid who dines upon the bones of her winded lovers." In 1977, Robert Lowell fled London to return to his former wife Elizabeth Hardwick. He died from a heart attack in the backseat of a taxi, clutching <b>Girl in Bed</b>, Lucian Freud's haunting portrait of Caroline. <br><br>Blackwood was an artist in her own right. Her literary talents were dark and satiric; her ten books of fiction and nonfiction betrayed an extraordinary eye for human physiognomy, attire, and behavior. Arguably her best book, <b>Great Granny Webster</b> described the comic terrors of her upbringing in Northern Ireland, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. She herself died of cancer on Valentine's Day 1996, at the age of sixty-four.<br><br><b>Dangerous Muse</b> is the first biography of Lady Caroline Blackwood. Drawing upon numerous interviews and unpublished letters from Blackwood's mother, Maureen Dufferin, and friends and family, including Andrew Harvey, Jonathan Raban, John Richardson, and Caroline's sister Perdita Blackwood, Nancy Schoenberger eloquently captures one of the most original and provocative figures in contemporary letters of the twentieth century. <br><b><br></b></p><p>"<b>Dangerous Muse</b><i> </i>is a dangerous book seductive, surprising, utterly beguiling. I don't know when a biography has held me captive like this unable and unwilling to escape from Blackwood, her husbands, her silences, her beauty and recklessness. Schoenberger writes like an angel, researches like a demon, paints portraits like a Rembrandt.

These happy times from her childhood were the foundation of many of her stories. Her illustrations portraying the idyllic landscape as a playground for children dressed in sumptuous Regency clothing offered a romanticized escape from the realities of the ever-encroaching industrialized world. In her costume designs, she combined the influences of her mother, an accomplished seamstress, with those of her father, a master engraver. She studied art in London where she developed a close relationship with printer Edmund Evans (1826 1905). Together they produced more than 150 books.

Now, this text: reduced to one-fifth, a faithful outline of most of the events, this American translation of a German adaptation for children reads well enough, but almost all of Gogol's vibrant tapestry of peasant life has vanished, along with so many details of plot and character that the truncated remnant is puzzling at best--it's not even clear that the devils here are figments of rural credulity. But Spirin's illustrations, evidently inspired by the full text, are splendid. Known for his lush, romantic paintings for fairy tales (most recently The White Cat, 1990), this Russian artist uses his considerable skill here to far more interesting effect. Swirling, Brueghel-like crowds of lusty peasants--some rendered in vivid hues and others, drained of color, in a cinematic haze--mix with half-fantastic pigs and devils that seem to protrude through rips in the parchment-like paper: superb, imaginative response to Gogol's earthy story. The two belong together (publisher, please note!); meanwhile, these illustrations are too good to miss. (Fiction/Picture book. 8+) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As he mentions in a foreword, Blegvad models his Mary on the pen-and-ink version drawn by Bodecker himself in his nonsense collection Hurry, Hurry, Mary Dear! (reissued in 1987 and still in print); Blegvad, however, works in watercolors, splendidly reproduced here with a limpid clarity. The heroine, Mary, is a reedy woman. Her nose has a shape that would not be out of place on a snowman, and her white hair is tucked tidily into a bun?at least as the verse begins. Her husband delivers all the lines: "Not a minute to be lost,/ in a minute we get frost!/ In an hour we get snow!/ Drifts like houses! Ten below!" He puts Mary through her (nonstop) paces as the rhythms escalate: "Churn the butter, smoke the hams,/ Can tomatoes, put up jams." In the company of a black cat, Mary toils inside and outside her well-appointed home, oiling snowshoes, stoking fires, attending to sometimes ludicrous tasks (she "strings the beans" by hanging them on a clothesline). With each pause in the verse, Mary sags, her hair unraveling, her shoulders stooping, but she rallies with each new volley of rhyme. Of course, the husband, lolling in a rocking chair, gets his due in the end; what readers get is an absolute treat, two consummate artists making the most of a good joke. Ages 7-up. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5^-8. A rhyme done by Bodecker ("Let's Marry Said the Cherry") more than 20 years ago is here illustrated by his friend, the illustrious Blegvad, and verse and images work in tandem as easily as they must have when both men shared the same studio. A sinewy, white-haired, adorable matron, with axe and pot and shovel and stove, responds to her spouse's exhortations: "Hurry, hurry, Mary dear, / fall is over, winter's here" to "churn the butter, smoke the hams, can tomatoes, put up jams," along with knitting and stoking and oiling and whatnot. The charming illustrations show Mary performing all these activities and growing increasingly frazzled and besmirched, until, in the end, she gives her idle husband his comeuppance with the tea and donuts he has requested, although not in the way he might have chosen. The watercolors are full of the silver-gilt light of early winter, and gorgeous details are worth poring over: tomato plants drawn like lace and green, white, and purple turnips the size of pumpkins. Blegvad's foreword gracefully recalls their long friendship and Bodecker's death more than a decade ago. <i>GraceAnne A.

Must have for the collector!</p><p></p><h2>Font of Life: Ambrose, Augustine, and the Mystery of Baptism (Emblems of Antiquity)</h2><p>No two men were more influential in the early Church than Ambrose, the powerful Bishop of Milan, and Augustine, the philosopher from provincial Africa who would write <em>The Confessions</em> and <em>The City of God</em>. Different in background, they were also extraordinarily different in personality. In <em>Font</em> <em>of Life</em>, Garry Wills explores the remarkable moment when their lives intersected at one of the most important, yet rarely visited, sites in the Christian world. Hidden under the piazza of the Duomo in Milan lies part of the foundations of a fourth-century cathedral where, at dawn on Easter of 387, Augustine and a group of people seeking baptism gathered after an all-night vigil. Ambrose himself performed the sacrament and the catechumens were greeted by their fellows in the faith, which included Augustine's mother Monnica. Though the occasion had deep significance for the participants, this little cluster of devotees was unaware that they were creating the future of the Western church. Ambrose would go on to forge new liturgies, new forms of church music, and new chains of churches; Augustine would return to Africa to become Bishop of Hippo and one of the most influential writers of Christianity. Garry Wills uses the ancient baptistry to chronicle a pivotal chapter in the history of the Church, highlighting the often uncomfortable relationship between the two church fathers and exploring the mystery and meanings of the sacrament of baptism. In addition, he brings long overdue attention to an unjustly neglected landmark of early Christianity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Garry Wills</strong> is the author of many books, including <em>Bomb Power, What Jesus Meant, Why I Am a Catholic, Papal Sin</em>, and <em>Lincoln at Gettysburg</em>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize.<br><br>"Unusually instructive...But he does more than bring us down from the fairy-tale roof of the Duomo of Milan (the usual goal of tourists) to the ruins that now lie hidden beneath the ground. He takes us for a vertiginous drop of almost 1,800 years into a Christianity profoundly different from our own." --<em>New York Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Wills shows where Ambrose and Augustine differed from each other in theology, temperament, and even ritual preference. He engagingly offers insight into the religion, politics, and culture of the time." -- <em>Library Journal</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"A small masterpiece of exposition." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"A well-researched and fascinating historical look at Ambrose, Augustine, and the sacrament of baptism." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Garry Wills is as deft and compelling when he untangles the ideas and politics of the age of Augustine as when he writes about John Wayne or Abraham Lincoln. This is a work of fresh and genuinely original scholarship told with verve and a keen sense of why the issues of fourth-century Milan still matter today."--James J. O'Donnell, Georgetown University<p></p><br>"The font in the Milan baptistery where Ambrose baptized Augustine at Easter 387 provides the setting for Garry Wills's dramatic evocation of the relations between two of the most powerful and influential figures in the early Christian church. He reveals the personal and theological distance that separated them in the years before and after the baptism. Wills's depiction of Augustine's confrontation with Ambrose is like a magnificent diptych in which the figures take on shifting forms and colors as the light changes. This is a nuanced, perceptive, and utterly persuasive account of two great men."--G. W. Bowersock, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton <br><p></p><br>"The author's affection for his subjects fills out the human picture...The book surveys the intersection of the lives of two of the Latin patriarchs who left great, if different, marks on the church. It explores theology with narrative flow. It makes serious points with grace."--<em>America</em><p></p><br>"An interesting and evocative addition to Wills's impressive corpus." -- <em>Christian Century</em> <br><p></p><br>""<em>Font of Life</em> is an engaging read as well as a provocative contribution to the scholarship of Ambrose and Augustine. Like all good histories, it combines a thorough knowledge of period and personality with a spark of imaginative creativity. All who seek to know more about Ambrose and Augustine or who want to delve deeper into the late antique world in which they lived and wrote would do well to take up this book. It does not disappoint." --<em>Books and Culture</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Berenstain Bear Scouts and the Run-amuck Robot (Berenstain Bear Scouts)</h2><p>The Bear Scouts team up to help track down Robow, a supercharged robot on the loose who is running wild and turning Bear Country into Scare Country.

This New York Times bestseller details the author&#39;s life story (portrayed by Tom Cruise in the Oliver Stone film)--from a patriotic soldier in Vietnam, to his severe battlefield injury, to his role as the country&#39;s most outspoken anti-Vietnam War advocate, spreading his message from his wheelchair. Ron Kovic served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War. He was paralyzed from his chest down in combat in 1968 and has been in a wheelchair ever since. Kovic&#39;s powerful and moving new introduction sets this classic antiwar story in a contemporary context.</p><p>Kovic&#39;s powerful and moving new introduction to his New York Times bestselling book sets this classic antiwar story in a contemporary context."Born on the Fourth of July brings back the era of the Vietnam War at a time when the Establishment is trying to make the nation forget what they call the "Vietnam syndrome." Ron Kovic's memoir is written with poetic passion and grips your attention from the very first page to the last. It is a classic of anti-war literature and I hope it will be read by large numbers of young people, who will be both sobered and inspired by his story. --HOWARD ZINN <p>"Ron Kovic is one of the premier voices of a generation. The large irony of his birthday provides the background for a journey which begins with the unquestioning service in Vietnam, his terrible wounding with all the anger and bitterness that follows, and ends with his passionate discovery of a large and all too human heart. I'll say this flat out: If you want to understand the everlasting reverberations of our war in Vietnam and how it impacts our current events, you must read this book." --LARRY HEINEMANN, author of Paco's Story, winner of the National Book Award </p><p>"There is no book more relevant in the 21st century to healing the wound of Vietnam, which continues to bring so much pain to our country, as reflected in the last presidential election. Ron Kovic is the kid who John Wayne sent to war -- though the actor, like so many others in the macho pantheon of American culture, never saw combat. The incredible thing about Ron is that he never lost his sense of humor nor his deeply felt outrage, which has made him an incredibly effective witness, determined that other young peoples&#x2019; bodies not be wasted, as was his. It remains to Kovic to remind us that history matters, and that the cost of our high follies persists." --ROBERT SCHEER, Los Angeles Times columnist, bestselling author </p><p>"As relevant as ever, this book is an education. Ron is a true American, and his great heart and hard-won wisdom shine through these pages." --OLIVER STONE, filmmaker</p></p><h2>CLINICALLY ORIENTED ANATOMY, 7/E (WITH POINT ACCESS CODES)</h2><p>Paperback International Edition ...

Rashomon tells the chilling story of the killing of a samurai through the testimony of witnesses, including the spirit of the murdered man.

And in The Martyr, a beloved orphan raised by Jesuit priests is exiled when he refuses to admit that he made a local girl pregnant. He regains their love and respect only at the price of his life. All six tales in the collection show Akutagawa as a master storyteller and an exciting voice of modern Japanese literature.</p><p>Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892&#x2013;1927) was one of the most famous Japanese writers of the last century and was the author of Rashomon and other works.

The musical genius behind the group was John Phillips. In 1961, before the group was formed, teenaged Michelle Gilliam met Phillips, the two fell in love, lived together and eventually married. Michelle here tells the story of her life, particularly the years with John and with The Mamas and the Papas. She tells the story engagingly, giving us excellent portraits of the group's members: the charismatic, freewheeling John; friendly Denny Doherty, with whom she had a brief affair; overweight, bright, unhappy Cass Elliott; and herself, in the center of the '60s cultural upheaval. Her autobiography is published almost simultaneously with her husband's (Papa John, reviewed in Forecasts Apr. 18). Although hers is a sanitized account compared to John's, she is more successful at putting events into historical context.

Reprint. BAKER &amp; TAYLOR Bks</p><p>When Lorenzo de' Medici seized control of the Florentine Republic in 1512, he summarily fired the Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Signoria and set in motion a fundamental change in the way we think about politics. The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccolï¿½ Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <i>The Prince</i> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency. <i>--Tim Hogan</i>Here is the world's most famous master plan for seizing and holding power. Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince . . . a king . . . a president. When, in 1512, Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. In <i>The Prince</i> he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values; his prince would be man and beast, fox and lion. Today, this small sixteenth-century masterpiece has become essential reading for every student of government, and is the ultimate book on power politics.</p><h2>The Wire Primers: A Guide to Modern Music</h2><p>Since it was founded in 1982, <i>The Wire</i> magazine has covered a vast range of alternative, experimental, underground and non-mainstream music.

Reprint.</p><p>Dubbed by the Sunday Times as, &#39;Simply the best detective writer since Agatha Christie&#39; and by the Yorkshire Post as &#39;the most underrated British crime writer&#39;, Caroline Graham is the author of eight Inspector Barnaby novels.Many elements in Graham's Chief Inspector Barnaby mysteries harken back to Christie: a small English village setting, a cast of odd characters, a sagacious inspector with his loyal sergeant. In this fourth entry, following Death in Disguise, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle invites author Max Jennings to speak to them. Circle member Gerald Hadleigh is opposed to the choice but refuses to explain. He asks fellow member Rex St. John to stay with him throughout Jennings's visit. But after the event, the elderly St. John is tricked into departing, leaving Hadleigh alone with Jennings. The next morning, Hadleigh is found bludgeoned to death and Jennings is gone. The members of the Writers' Circle respond variously. St. John falls into a deep depression; Laura Hutton, whose love of the victim was unrequited, pitches into a days-long crying and drinking jag; Honoria Lyddiard evinces little reaction; her sister-in-law, Amy, and Sue Clapton are suitably shocked. Sue's husband, Brian, seems almost "gleeful." The skill with which Graham evokes these characters and explores their individual, often damaged, emotional histories rings of Rendell and P.D. James. The few too many coincidences in the plot will be forgiven for the crisp pace and satisfying twist at the end. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Distracted Preacher and Other Tales (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>The darkly passionate short stories of Thomas Hardy are compelling explorations of love, social class, superstition and legend.

Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat.'</p><p>Spirited and impulsive, Marianne Dashwood is the complete opposite to her controlled and sensible sister, Elinor. When it comes to matters of the heart, Marianne is passionate and romantic and soon falls for the charming, but unreliable Mr Willoughby. Elinor, in contrast, copes stoically with the news that her love, Edward Ferrars is promised to another.</p><p>It is through their shared experiences of love that both sisters come to learn that the key to a successful match comes from finding the perfect mixture of rationality and feeling.</p></p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

His obsession with the insects he shares the room with and his beautifully articulated observations of himself on the edge of physical and mental collapse extend out to include the insect-like habitues of the local cafe - the charlatans, the indolent landowners, and even a levitating priest who has been dead for six years.

The narrator, a Swiss historian in the final months of a long journey in the East, settles into the 117th room he has occupied en route, this one on a "chimerical island" in the heart of India. Down on his luck, nearly broke, feverish, still searching for his elusive identity, he acquires a book on Indian insects and thereupon shifts his microscopic observation from "that pretty world of killers," the crawling verminous creatures in his room, to people in the vicinitycafe habitues, charlatans and fake exorcists; indolent, decadent land-owners; a levitating priest who's been dead for six years; a huge Tamil merchant-woman who talks to the titular Scorpion-Fish, a combination of exotic beauty and deadly menace that symbolizes for the narrator the Eastern scene, climate, character and culture.

Take Japan's Simmered Mixed Vegetables, a deceptively straightforward preparation made complex with a sauce of soy, sake and dashi, a kelp-based stock that's the Japanese equivalent of chicken broth; exotic vegetables, including taro and lotus root, come alive in the salty-sweet braising liquid. Thailand's Sweet Corn Cakes are another example of simple-on-the-outside, intricate-on-the-inside vegan cookery, an addictive spin on traditional corn fritters spiced with ginger, garlic and coriander, and served alongside chili sauce and cucumber relish. Unfortunately, the cookbook is a bit confusing; the recipes are separated by country rather than, say, main ingredient, and the fine, full-color photographs of the dishes are all crammed in the middle of the book. Though cooks may spend extra time searching for ways to use up surplus zucchini, it's an appealing browse full of tasty diversions. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ajit and Raj Randhawa were well-educated, well-off Sikhs in the Punjab region of India. But despite their high social status, the Randhawas wanted more for their family-the opportunities that only America could offer.</p><p>So they left behind all they had known and settled in Bamberg, South Carolina (population: 2,500). As the first Indian family in a small Southern town in the early 1970s, the Randhawas faced ignorance, prejudice, and sometimes blatant hostility. Nikki remembers stopping at a roadside produce stand with her father, who always wore his traditional Sikh turban. Within minutes, two police cars pulled to make sure they weren't thieves.</p><p>But the Randhawas taught their children that they should never think of themselves as victims. They stressed that if you work hard and stay true to yourself, you can overcome any obstacle. The key is believing that can't is not an option.</p><p>The family struggled to make ends meet while starting a clothing business in their living room, eventually growing it into a multimillion- dollar success. At age twelve, Nikki started to do the bookkeeping and taxes after school. After graduating from college and entering the business world, she watched business owners like her parents battle government bureaucracy and overregulation.</p><p>Her frustration inspired her to get into politics and run for the state legislature. That first campaign, against an entrenched incumbent, led to racial and religious slurs and threats-but Haley, like her parents, refused to back down. She won on a promise to fight for reform, lean budgets, and government accountability, which is exactly what she did-much to the dismay of South Carolina's old guard politicians.</p><p>Soon she had a reputation as a conservative leader who could get things done. In the same state where her family was once ridiculed, she inspired a diverse grassroots following. In November 2010 she was elected South Carolina's first female governor and first nonwhite governor, and only the second Indian American governor in the country.</p><p>Haley's story, as told firsthand in this inspiring memoir, is a testament to the power of determination, faith, and family. And it's proof that the American Dream is still strong and true in the twenty- first century.</p></p><p><b>Nikki Haley</b> was elected to the South Carolina General Assembly in 2004 and reelected in 2006 and 2008. She was elected governor in 2010.

He has grown comfortable playing his harp at JoJo's in the French Quarter and teaching blues history at Tulane. A difficult case was the last thing on the blues tracker's mind. <br><br>When new details on the mysterious death of a blues record producer surface from a legendary guitarist over a bottle of Crown Royal, Nick becomes intrigued. In 1959, Billy Lyons' body was found stabbed with an ice pick and floating in Lake Michigan. His lover, a blues singer named Ruby Walker, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder. But even after Ruby was sentenced, rumors emerged of a gambling debt to the black mafia or a possible hit called by Lyons' partner, Moses Jordan, who moved on to immortality with another label. <br><br>After arriving at Chicago's Union Station, Travers learns there are still those who'd like Billy Lyons' murder to remain unsolved. He soon has fresh blood splattered on his boots and he's running in the blackened snow from a rogues gallery of killers that include a 6-foot-5, 300 pound breathing ball of hate named Stagger Lee Jordan and a beautiful pair of sociopaths--Butcher Knife-Totin' Annie and Fast-Lovin' Fannie--two women with respective talents for love and death. <br><br>His quest for Lyons' killer retraces the route of the Delta greats during the Great Migration of blacks after World War II. From the historic Maxwell Street Market to the South Side's Checkerboard Lounge, take a hint from Robert Johnson when he sang, <i>"C'mon. Baby don't you want to go. Back to that same old place--My Sweet Home Chicago." </i><br></p><p>Nick Travers, who made his first appearance in <i>Crossroad Blues</i>, is a musicologist in the Alan Lomax tradition--a blues historian who teaches at Tulane and devotes his spare time to tracking down the forgotten greats of the past. He's been trying to line up an interview with one of them: Ruby Walker, a '50s blues songstress who's been in an Illinois prison for 40 years for murdering her lover. Ruby finally agrees to talk to Nick--<i>if</i> he'll look into the circumstances of the crime for which she was unjustly convicted. That takes Nick back to Chicago at Christmas, and sets him on the trail of a legendary, mythic figure named Stagger Lee, who's not a myth after all, but a man with a deadly secret and no compunction about killing to keep it hidden. <p> Nick's hopeless love affair with Kate, first met in author Ace Atkins' previous suspense story, gets a reprise here, too. Now an investigative reporter with a Windy City paper, she teams up with Nick to find out what really happened and spring Ruby from jail. What makes this otherwise routine mystery interesting is Nick's (and the author's) encyclopedic knowledge and deep appreciation of his subject (music, not murder). The pacing is pretty slow. If you put a little Muddy Waters on the stereo, you won't mind stopping to hear a particularly sweet riff before you start reading again. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Ace Atkins, twenty-nine, covers crime for the <i>Tampa Tribune</i>.

Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. Enter the wizard, Bayaz.

Invaluable for the insight they give into the daily life of the poet and his friendship with Coleridge, they are also remarkable for their spontaneity and immediacy, and for the vivid descriptions of people, places, and incidents that inspired some of Wordsworth's best-loved poems. <em>The Grasmere Journal</em> was begun at Dove Cottage in May 1800 and kept for three years. Dorothy notes the walks and the weather, the friends, country neighbors and beggars on the roads; she sets down accounts of the garden, of Wordsworth's marriage, their concern for Coleridge, the composition of poetry. The earlier <em>Alfoxden Journal</em> was written during 1797-8, when the Wordsworths lived near Coleridge in Somerset. Not intended for publication, but to "give Wm Pleasure by it," both journals have a quality recognized by Wordsworth when he wrote of Dorothy that "she gave me eyes, she gave me ears."</p><p>Pamela Woof is a Lecturer in Literature, Centre for Lifelong Learning, University of Newcastle upon Tyne.</p><h2>Stories About God's People (Units 1, 2, &amp; 3) (Grade 2) (Bible Nurture and Reader Series)</h2><p>&#34;If you train your children carefully until they are seven years old, they are already three-quarters educated.&#34; This quote recognizes the importance of the critical early years in molding a child&#39;s life.

She's Nanette Hayes, and this time around she's flying high -- back to Paris, the city she's always loved, to find Viv, the jet-setting aunt she still idolizes. But her search will plunge her into a decades-old murder mystery that will endanger her, her fiercely sexy new lover, and Viv. And to solve it, she will have to face hard truths about the past and her own illusions -- and heartbreak of the seriously fatal kind.</p><p>CHARLOTTE CARTER is currently a New Yorker and works as a freelance editor and proofreader. She has lived in France, North Africa, Canada, and Chicago and has a lifelong love for mystery fiction.Nanette Hayes's mother is practically in tears. She's had a couple of cryptic distress signals from Nanette's Aunt Viv in Paris, and she knows the secret inheritance of $10,000 she's never turned over to her despised sister-in-law could be a lifesaver. Is there any way Nan could take a week off from her teaching job and fly over to the City of Light to look for her raffish aunt? You bet there is, says Nan, whose teaching job is a myth designed to keep her mother purring, and who knows the anonymous crowds she blows the sax for on Big Apple streets won't miss her for a week. So Nan, fortified by gallons of in-flight Veuve Clicquot and drunk with the romantic possibilities of a city she hasn't seen since she was a girl, settles down in Vivian Hayes's dingy hotel and begins her search. It takes much less than a week for her to realize that she's got about as much chance of finding her walkabout aunt as finding the adorable little bistros she dined in the last time she saw Paris. Luckily, she's taken in hand by Andre, a fine mulatto street-violinist from Detroit, who fills up the hours she's not finding Aunt Viv with diverse cultural experiences, etc. Everything's going swimminglyNan's made contact with a promisingly grungy gangster who's been questioned in the recent death of another American woman, she's tied Vivian into a 20-year-old murder, she's getting some great meals and sexuntil the last thirty pages, when Carter (Rhode Island Red, 1997) suddenly has the nerve to pretend she's been plotting a mystery all along. Nan's second case works less well as a whodunit than as a nostalgic tour of black Paris, and a salute to Black History Month. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

"When we understand the worm, we will understand life," predicted John Sulston, one of the three Nobel laureates, and his prediction proved astonishingly accurate. Four years later, the research that led to this extraordinary event garnered three scientists a Nobel Prize. Along with Robert Horvitz and Sydney Brenner, Sulston discovered the phenomenon of programmed cell death in the worm, an essential concept that explains how biological development occurs in animal life and, as Horvitz later showed, how it occurs in human life. <i>C. elegans</i> is about as simple as an animal can be, but understanding its genetic organization is helping to reveal the mechanisms of life and, by extension, the mechanisms of our own lives. <i>In the Beginning Was the Worm</i> shows that in order to unlock the secrets of the human genome we must first understand the worm. <br><br>But this story is about more than just the worm. It is about how an eccentric group of impassioned scientists toiled in near anonymity for years, driven only by a deep passion for knowledge and scientific discovery. It is the story of countless hours of research, immense ambition, and one of the greatest discoveries in human history.</p><p>The fascinating story of the quest to decode how a creature works in its entirety. A tiny transparent nematode worm only half a millimeter long has been the subject of intensive study by a select group of biologists since the early 1960s culminating in the award of the 2002 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine to the main protagonists. The voyage of discovery has been arguably one of the most important quests in modern biology and has stimulated much of modern thinking about genetics, development and neurobiology.Andrew Brown is a journalist who writes extensively for the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Independent</i>, and the <i>Daily Mail</i>.

In a world where religion is being pushed to the margins of society, we find loyalty to scriptural teachings, adherence to time-honored values, and belief in absolute truths in short supply. <p></p> When respected religious educator and author Robert L. Millet talks with those who are troubled by newly public historical information, anti-Mormon propaganda, the Church's position on marriage, family, and gender issues, or other concerns, he's empathetic and wants to help. He pleads, "When did we lose our believing hearts and confidence in the Lord's servants? Whatever happened to faith?" <p></p> From the author of <i>Living in the Eleventh Hour</i> and <i>Grace Works,</i> this timely book is all about faith what it is, what is isn't, how it is developed, and how we may remain solid and steadfast in our beliefs and convictions. His is a call to pay little heed to the way society is moving and an invitation to be a part of a counter culture of faith and devotion. Therein is safety and peace.</p><p>Robert L.

The magic had gone out of the world. All over Earthsea the mages had forgotten their spells, the springs of wizardry were running dry.

It must have been policeman's instinct, or experience of parents whose children have suddenly left home. The man was approaching down the dingy street of terraced houses from the opposite direction. He was in his early fifties, and had a slightly dog-eared look: his shoulders were stooped, his moustache droopy and unkempt, the thin head of hair was uncombed. He was carrying a copy of the <i>Sun.</i> He looked the sort of man the world has not been kind to, and one who has not had the drive or personality to carve his own way in spite of it.<br>Sure enough he turned into number seventeen.<br>'Mr Coughlan?'<br>The man turned and looked at him, his hand still holding the key to open the front door. Charlie waved his ID card close to his eyes, which were bleared. When he had scanned it, the slack face registered surprise.<br>'Oh, I didn't expect --'<br>'A black copper?' said Charlie genially. 'Quite a lot of us around these days.'<br>The face appeared aggrieved.<br>'I didn't mean that. You're taking me up all wrong. I meant I didn't expect anyone from the police to come around. Ronnie Withers down at the Railway Arms said the police never bothered with missing teenagers. Said there were too many of them, and there was nothing they could do.'<br>'Well, Ronnie Withers was wrong, wasn't he? Do you mind if I come in?'<br>'No, mate, come on through.' He let them in through the front door, and led the way down a dim hall into a back room that abutted a kitchen. Yesterday's <i>Sun</i> was on the floor beside the easy chair, and yesterday's pots and pans were still on the draining board in the kitchen. The place was thick with dust and with food smells. 'Haven't had a chance to clean up,' said Mr Coughlan, clearing a place for Charlie by removing the <i>TV Week</i> from the other easy chair. 'The missus has been knocked for six by this, I can tell you. Just can't get over it. She'll be in bed still. Don't need her, do you?'<br>'I expect you can tell me what I need to know,' said Charlie, settling into the chair. 'By the way, your friend Ronnie Withers wasn't entirely wrong.'<br>'He's sharp, is Ronnie,' said Arthur Coughlan, with an air of acknowledging a pub guru. Charlie leaned forward in his chair to explain what parents always found it difficult to accept.<br>'Normally there's not much that we can do when teenagers take off, and beyond putting them on a register all we can advise parents to do is wait and hope.'<br>He had put it as tactfully as possible, but Arthur Coughlan looked even more depressed.<br>'What's different about Alan, then?' he asked. 'The fact that he's so young?'<br>Charlie shook his head.<br>'I'm afraid sixteen isn't all that young, Mr Coughlan. There's kids a lot younger than that sleeping rough in Leeds, and hundreds that age under the bridges in London. No, it's the fact that we had two reported disappearances more or less simultaneously from the same school. That is unusual.'<br>Arthur Coughlan nodded.<br>'Is that Katy Bourne? The headmaster asked us about her. His mum and I didn't even know the name, I'm afraid.'<br>That Charlie had found out already. But the ignorance of parents whose children had left home about even the most mundane aspects of their lives was boundless, in his experience.<br>'Were there any signs that Alan had a serious new girlfriend in the weeks before he took off?'<br>'Not that we noticed,' said Arthur Coughlan, positively, for him.<br>'And you always do get told?'<br>'It's always clear. He wouldn't sit down and tell us outright. But Alan isn't like some of the kids these days.'<br>'What exactly do you mean?'<br>'He has girlfriends. But he isn't the kind who's been sleeping with girls since he was thirteen. That happens, you know. I think it's disgusting. The girls find themselves pregnant before they're anything but children themselves. How can you expect kids to make proper mothers and fathers? Anyway, Alan isn't like that.'<br>'I didn't say he was, Mr Coughlan. In any case, even if he is having any kind of relationship with this Katy Bourne, it would be unusual for the two of them to go missing together.'<br>Arthur Coughlan's expression was obstinate.<br>'I don't think they have gone missing together. Like I say, we never heard the name. We know if Alan has a girlfriend. He'll bring her home, and they'll go up to his room and play records, go to a gig. Then after a few weeks, maybe a couple of months, there'll be a tiff, or they'll both just lose interest. Just like we used to do at his age, Mr Peace.'<br>Charlie was disconcerted by being classed with a fifty-year-old. Perhaps being a policeman had aged him in people's eyes. He smiled a sort of acceptance, however.<br>'So for you and your wife, Alan is just a normal teenager?'<br>'Alan <i>is</i> just a normal teenager. And nicer than most.'<br>'How would you describe him? Describe his character?'<br>This stumped him.<br>'He's a nice lad.' Feeling the inadequacy as well as the repetitiousness of this, Mr Coughlan stumbled on. 'He's quite bright at school -- expected to do well in his GCSEs. And he's had no particular advantages, because his mother and I have never had much of an education.' He gestured around him. 'It's not a bookish household, as you can see, and that usually makes all the difference, they say. He's never been any trouble -- well, you can never say that, can you? Wouldn't be natural. We've had rows, had to lay down the law now and again, but we wouldn't have it any other way, him being a teenager. It's more difficult for them today than it was when I was growing up, with all the nastiness being thrown at them from the television and the newspapers. But Alan's a good lad...a good lad.'<br>He faded into silence. Charlie said gently:<br>'You'd had a row just before he left home, hadn't you?'<br>Arthur Coughlan looked at the floor.<br>'Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Just about cleaning up his room...The normal.'<br>Charlie's instinct told him this was a lie. He decided to let it be for the moment, till he knew more of the circumstances. He wanted to keep Coughlan on his side.<br>'Was that on the Friday night?'<br>'Yes. I don't believe that was why he left home. He was quite normal Saturday breakfast time.'<br>'But it was Saturday he took off, wasn't it?'<br>The man nodded, sadly, uncertainly.<br>'Yes...I always go and help out at the Railway Arms Saturday and Sunday lunchtimes. I've been unemployed two years and more, you see, and any little bit of money helps. Used to be a warehouseman at Pickerings, till they went bust.'<br>'Had your being unemployed caused problems?'<br>He shook his head emphatically.<br>'With Alan? Not so you'd notice.' Then he thought for a moment. 'Well, I suppose we did get on each other's nerves in the holidays, but not badly. His mother has a cleaning job with Lloyd's Bank, so she's out early evenings. It's not as though we're all three of us here all the time.'<br>'Sorry -- I interrupted,' said Charlie. 'What happened on Saturday?'<br>'Well, I went down to the Railway. His mother went to do the weekly shop at Morrisons, then called in at the Railway for her lunch. That's usual. We came back after two, when things quietened down at the pub. Alan wasn't here, but we thought nothing of it. He didn't have to clock in and out.'<br>'When did you start worrying?'<br>'When he didn't come home for his tea. It was shepherd's pie, his favourite, and he knew that. We rang Darren Sorby, his friend -- he hadn't been at theirs. Then we went up to his room.'<br>He stopped.<br>'How much had gone?'<br>'Not everything -- not by a long chalk,' said Coughlan firmly. 'That's why I'm sure he means to come home. But all his favourite clothes had gone, quite a few records, some books -- including some school books. So I'm sure he intends to go on with school, do his A-levels, like he said he wants.'<br>Charlie wondered whether he might be clutching at straws. Still, taking books and records did not suggest sleeping rough.<br>'Doesn't sound as if he thought he'd be on the streets,' he said, encouragingly. 'What did he take all this in?'<br>'His rucksack. He had a hiking holiday in Northumberland last summer. Was going to take another one this summer.'<br>'So he didn't take a case?'<br>'No. Well, he wouldn't. A case to a teenager looks sort of elderly, doesn't it?'<br>'I suppose so. But somehow it doesn't look as if he expected to stay away for a long time.'<br>Something in his words aggravated an itching worry in the man's mind.<br>'Expected...A lot of things can happen that you don't expect, if you're sleeping rough.'<br>'We don't know that he's doing that,' said Charlie, urgently. 'In fact, I'd say it was pretty unlikely. Do you have a recent photograph of him?'<br>Arthur Coughlan got up and rummaged in a drawer.<br>'There's his passport photograph,' he said, handing over a European passport. 'It's two years old now. We took him to Spain with us. We didn't care for the place, but he enjoyed it. Oh, and there's this.'<br>He took a colour snapshot in a cheap frame from the wall unit. It showed a teenager in shorts and short-sleeved shirt, rucksack on his back, smiling into the camera -- fresh-faced, a lock of hair straggling over his right eye. Charlie thought it bore out his father's description of him -- a nice lad: likeable, responsible.<br>'Was this on the walking holiday you mentioned?'<br>'That's right.'<br>'So quite recent. I'll take this. Does this mean he was on the holiday with a friend?'<br>'Oh yes. We wouldn't have let him go otherwise. As it was, his mother worried herself sick. He was with Darren Sorby, from his form at school.'<br>'Perhaps I should talk to Darren. Are they still good friends now?'<br>'Oh yes. They're mates. Darren's very worried, but we couldn't get anything out of him we didn't know already.'<br>Charlie took his leave. He had no doubt this man had been a good parent by his lights, but he found both the man and the house dispiriting. He thought he should try to speak to Katy Bourne's parents before he went to the pair's school. She lived a mile and a half away in a little box on an estate of little boxes, built in a hideous orange brick, with a sign at the end of the street saying Pelsett Homes and showing there were still some for sale. These were houses for the newly-married, the newly-divorced, and the old. Katy's box had come out in a rash of lead-lighting. He rang twice and got no answer.<br>'She won't be back till four,' came a voice. 'She works at the post office in Morley Road.'<br>There was an elderly couple working in a little scrap of garden next door, and bumping bottoms every time they took a step backwards. It seemed an act of faith to plant anything natural in such an environment. No doubt they had bought the house on retirement, wanting a place where everything was new, and everything would go on working for their lifetime. Fifty per cent right. Charlie strolled over to the knee-high fence.<br>'Thanks. Is there a Mr Bourne, by the way?'<br>'No,' said the woman, pushing a strand of hair out of her eyes. 'I'm not sure there ever was. There was a man -- I'm pretty sure he wasn't a husband -- when they moved in here, but he took off soon afterwards -- matter of weeks, so far as I remember.'<br>'I see. Do you know why?'<br>'Just said he'd had enough.' She hesitated, then lowered her voice as if the secret police might be listening. 'She's...well, not a very sympathetic sort of person.'<br>'Right. I'll bear that in mind. And the daughter?'<br>'Oh, very quiet. Don't see much of her. She's not in any trouble, is she?'<br>'I hope not,' said Charlie, moving off.<br>The school he drove to, parking with the teachers' cars, was so familiar to him he hardly gave a glance to the peeling paint on the board walls, the ill-fitting windows, the litter-bestrewed playground, and the general air of neglect, as if children would soon be a thing of the past and it wasn't worth spending money on them. The headmaster had been alerted in advance, and was waiting for him.<br>'I thought you'd want to speak to their best friends,' he said, almost the moment Charlie came into his study, 'so I've alerted them. Darren Sorby and Sharon Reilly.'<br>'Excellent. But what about you?'<br>The headmaster, who obviously wanted to shunt him on immediately, spread out his hands.<br>'We have four hundred pupils here. The most I get is an impression, unless they're problem students or very bright. I've talked to the form teachers though. Alan seems -- or seemed, before this -- unproblematic: quite good at his work, not a great one for games, hot on the environment. It may not go very deep, but it's a step in the right direction.'<br>'Sure. And Katy Bourne?'<br>'Ah, there may be some problems there. Rather a lonely child -- adolescent, I should say. It wasn't easy to find a friend of hers. I would say a distinctly unhappy young woman.'<br>Charlie thought for a moment.<br>'Unhappy because she's lonely, or lonely because she's unhappy?'<br>'I think you may be the best person to find that out. You're closer to their age.'<br>He had made available an unused classroom. There seemed to be plenty of them: school rolls were declining. When the two friends came in Charlie took a desk by the window, through which a fearsome draught beat on his neck, and sat them in two desks on the other side of the aisle.<br>'Now,' he said, looking first at Darren Sorby, 'I get the sense of Alan Coughlan being fairly bright, well adjusted, with a lot of interests -- would that be right?'<br>Darren Sorby nodded.<br>'So what went wrong, or what happened? That's not the sort of person who suddenly goes missing as a rule.'<br>Darren screwed up his mouth.<br>'Well, he never said anything to me.'<br>'Had he been any different these last few weeks -- or perhaps just the last few days?'<br>Darren considered this.<br>'Maybe a bit quieter like. Sort of thoughtful. But you see, we'd just done our GCSEs, so I thought that he was probably worried, or had been overdoing the studying.'<br>'He was going to stay on at school if he did well?'<br>'Yes. Or maybe go to the Jakob Kramer College.'<br>'Did he have any reasons to think that he might have done badly?'<br>'No. At the time he seemed quite happy with the papers.'<br>'So how long had he been quiet and thoughtful?'<br>Darren considered again. He was a slow considerer.<br>'Difficult to say, really...Just a few days, so far as I remember. He was rather quiet on the Wednesday before he took off. We'd been intending to go into town to <i>The Last Knight,</i> but then he said he wasn't in the mood.'<br>'Without giving a reason?'<br>'No. I'd have said if he had.'<br>'And you have no reason at all to connect him with Katy Bourne?'<br>Darren shook his head vigorously.<br>'No. So far as I know he'd never heard the name. Certainly he'd never mentioned her to me. And he would've if she was his girlfriend, or if he was even interested.'<br>'She was younger than him, wasn't she?'<br>'Yes, a year younger. But he's had girlfriends in lower years before. It wasn't that.'<br>Charlie transferred his gaze to Sharon Reilly. The girl was a little overweight, not pretty, but with sharp eyes.<br>'She never said anything to me. But --'<br>'But you're not all that close,' supplied Charlie.<br>'No. And...she never told you things. Especially not things like that.'<br>'Do you mean she was secretive?'<br>Sharon screwed up her face.<br>'Not that exactly. More that she was...unhappy.' Charlie noted it had been the headmaster's word too, no doubt suggested to him by one of the girl's teachers. 'She didn't think anyone could be interested in her. Didn't think she was <i>interesting</i> enough. She could hardly believe it if you made friendly gestures. I think it's what the magazines call low self-esteem.'<br>Sharon seemed a lot brighter than Darren Sorby. Charlie wondered ...</p><h2>Court-Martial at Parris Island: The Ribbon Creek Incident</h2><p>On April 8, 1956, drill instructor Matthew McKeon led Platoon 71 on a forced night march through the backwaters of the Parris Island recruit depot in an effort to restore flagging discipline.

Today, corporations govern our lives. They determine what we eat, what we watch, what we wear, where we work, and what we do. We are inescapably surrounded by their culture, iconography, and ideology. And, like the church and the monarchy in other times, they posture as infallible and omnipotent, glorifying themselves in imposing buildings and elaborate displays. Increasingly, corporations dictate the decisions of their supposed overseers in government and control domains of society once firmly embedded within the public sphere. The corporation's dramatic rise to dominance is one of the remarkable events of modern history, not least because of the institution's inauspicious beginnings. </p><p> Long before Enron's scandalous collapse, the corporation, a fledgling institution, was engulfed in corruption and fraud. Throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, stockbrokers, known as "jobbers," prowled the infamous coffee shops of London's Exchange Alley, a maze of lanes between Lombard Street, Cornhill, and Birchin Lane, in search of credulous investors to whom they could sell shares in bogus companies. Such companies flourished briefly, nourished by speculation, and then quickly collapsed. Ninety-three of them traded between 1690 and 1695. By 1698, only twenty were left. In 1696 the commissioners of trade for England reported that the corporate form had been "wholly perverted" by the sale of company stock "to ignorant men, drawn in by the reputation, falsely raised and artfully spread, concerning the thriving state of [the] stock." Though the commissioners were appalled, they likely were not surprised. </p><p> Businessmen and politicians had been suspicious of the corporation from the time it first emerged in the late sixteenth century. Unlike the prevailing partnership form, in which relatively small groups of men, bonded together by personal loyalties and mutual trust, pooled their resources to set up businesses they ran as well as owned, the corporation separated ownership from management -- one group of people, directors and managers, ran the firm, while another group, shareholders, owned it. That unique design was believed by many to be a recipe for corruption and scandal. Adam Smith warned in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> that because managers could not be trusted to steward "other people's money," "negligence and profusion" would inevitably result when businesses organized as corporations. Indeed, by the time he wrote those words in 1776, the corporation had been banned in England for more than fifty years. In 1720, the English Parliament, fed up with the epidemic of corporate high jinks plaguing Exchange Alley, had outlawed the corporation (though with some exceptions). It was the notorious collapse of the South Sea Company that had prompted it to act. </p><p> Formed in 1710 to carry on exclusive trade, including trade in slaves, with the Spanish colonies of South America, the South Sea Company was a scam from the very start. Its directors, some of the leading lights of political society, knew little about South America, had only the scantiest connection to the continent (apparently, one of them had a cousin who lived in Buenos Aires), and must have known that the King of Spain would refuse to grant them the necessary rights to trade in his South American colonies. As one director conceded, "unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense...abandoning their own commerce, throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and, in short, bent on their own ruin," they would never part with the exclusive power to trade in their own colonies. Yet the directors of the South Sea Company promised potential investors "fabulous profits" and mountains of gold and silver in exchange for common British exports, such as Cheshire cheese, sealing wax, and pickles. </p><p> Investors flocked to buy the company's stock, which rose dramatically, by sixfold in one year, and then quickly plummeted as shareholders, realizing that the company was worthless, panicked and sold. In 1720 -- the year a major plague hit Europe, public anxiety about which "was heightened," according to one historian, "by a superstitious fear that it had been sent as a judgment on human materialism" -- the South Sea Company collapsed. Fortunes were lost, lives were ruined, one of the company's directors, John Blunt, was shot by an angry shareholder, mobs crowded Westminster, and the king hastened back to London from his country retreat to deal with the crisis. The directors of the South Sea Company were called before Parliament, where they were fined, and some of them jailed, for "notorious fraud and breach of trust." Though one parliamentarian demanded they be sewn up in sacks, along with snakes and monies, and then drowned, they were, for the most part, spared harsh punishment. As for the corporation itself, in 1720 Parliament passed the Bubble Act, which made it a criminal offense to create a company "presuming to be a corporate body," and to issue "transferable stocks without legal authority." </p><p> Today, in the wake of corporate scandals similar to and every bit as nefarious as the South Sea bubble, it is unthinkable that a government would ban the corporate form. Even modest reforms -- such as, for example, a law requiring companies to list employee stock options as expenses in their financial reports, which might avoid the kind of misleadingly rosy financial statements that have fueled recent scandals -- seem unlikely from a U.S. federal government that has failed to match its strong words at the time of the scandals with equally strong actions. Though the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, signed into law in 2002 to redress some of the more blatant problems of corporate governance and accounting, provides welcome remedies, at least on paper, the federal government's general response to corporate scandals has been sluggish and timid at best. What is revealed by comparing that response to the English Parliament's swift and draconian measures of 1720 is the fact that, over the last three hundred years, corporations have amassed such great power as to weaken government's ability to control them. A fledgling institution that could be banned with the stroke of a legislative pen in 1720, the corporation now dominates society and government. </p><p> How did it become so powerful? </p><p> The genius of the corporation as a business form, and the reason for its remarkable rise over the last three centuries, was -- and is -- its capacity to combine the capital, and thus the economic power, of unlimited numbers of people. Joint-stock companies emerged in the sixteenth century, by which time it was clear that partnerships, limited to drawing capital from the relatively few people who could practicably run a business together, were inadequate for financing the new, though still rare, large-scale enterprises of nascent industrialization. In 1564 the Company of the Mines Royal was created as a joint-stock company, financed by twenty-four shares sold for ï¿½1,200 each; in 1565, the Company of Mineral and Battery Works raised its capital by making calls on thirty-six shares it had previously issued. The New River Company was formed as a joint-stock company in 1606 to transport fresh water to London, as were a number of other utilities. Fifteen joint-stock companies were operating in England in 1688, though none with more than a few hundred members. Corporations began to proliferate during the final decade of the seventeenth century, and the total amount of investment in joint-stock companies doubled as the business form became a popular vehicle for financing colonial enterprises. The partnership still remained the dominant form for organizing businesses, however, though the corporation would steadily gain on it and then overtake it. </p><p> In 1712, Thomas Newcomen invented a steam-driven machine to pump water out of a coal mine and unwittingly started the industrial revolution. Over the next century, steam power fueled the development of large-scale industry in England and the United States, expanding the scope of operations in mines, textiles (and the associated trades of bleaching, calico printing, dyeing, and calendaring), mills, breweries, and distilleries. Corporations multiplied as these new larger-scale undertakings demanded significantly more capital investment than partnerships could raise. In postrevolutionary America, between 1781 and 1790, the number of corporations grew tenfold, from 33 to 328. </p><p> In England too, with the Bubble Act's repeal in 1825 and incorporation once again legally permitted, the number of corporations grew dramatically, and shady dealing and bubbles were once again rife in the business world. Joint-stock companies quickly became "the fashion of the age," as the novelist Sir Walter Scott observed at the time, and as such were fitting subjects for satire. Scott wryly pointed out that, as a shareholder in a corporation, an investor could make money by spending it (indeed, he likened the corporation to a machine that could fuel its operations with its own waste): </p><p> </p><blockquote>Such a person [an investor] buys his bread from his own Baking Company, his milk and cheese from his own Dairy Company...drinks an additional bottle of wine for the benefit of the General Wine Importation Company, of which he is himself a member. Every act, which would otherwise be one of mere extravagance, is, to such a person...reconciled to prudence. Even if the price of the article consumed be extravagant, and the quality indifferent, the person, who is in a manner his own customer, is only imposed upon for his own benefit. Nay, if the Joint-stock Company of Undertakers shall unite with the medical faculty...under the firm of Death and the Doctor, the shareholder might contrive to secure his heirs a handsome slice of his own death-bed and funeral expenses.</blockquote> <p> At the moment Scott was satirizing it, however, the corporation was poised to begin its ascent to dominance ...</p></p><h2>Dodger&#39;s Guide to London: Based on Original Notes Penned by Jack Dodger Himself</h2><p><b>All you ever (<i>or never</i>) wanted to know about Victorian London, penned by Jack Dodger.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROLL UP!

They are a mixed-race group of foreign mercenaries from Greece, Gaul, and Syria. The child&#x2019;s name, unknown to them, is Jesus, and his only crime is that some believe he will be the next king of the Jewish people. The current monarch, a dying half-Jewish, half-Arab despot named Herod, is so intent on ensuring the baby&#x2019;s death that his army has been ordered to murder every male child under the age of two years in Bethlehem.* None of the soldiers knows what the child&#x2019;s mother and father look like, or the precise location of his home, thus the need to kill every baby boy in the small town and surrounding area. This alone will guarantee the extermination of the potential king.</p> <p>It is springtime in Judea, the peak of lambing season. The rolling dirt road takes the army past thick groves of olive trees and shepherds tending their flocks. The soldiers&#x2019; feet are clad in sandals, their legs are bare, and they wear the skirtlike <i>pteruges</i> to cover their loins. The young men sweat profusely beneath the plates of armor on their chests and the tinned bronze attic helmets that cover the tops of their heads and the sides of their faces.</p> <p>The soldiers are well aware of Herod&#x2019;s notorious cruelty and his penchant for killing anyone who would try to threaten his throne. But there is no moral debate about the right or wrong of slaughtering infants.&#x2020; Nor do the soldiers question whether they will have the nerve to rip a screaming child from his mother&#x2019;s arms and carry out the execution. When the time comes, they will follow orders and do their jobs&#x2014;or risk being immediately killed for insubordination.</p> <p>The sword&#x2019;s blade is how they plan to dispatch the babies. All soldiers are armed with the Judean version of the razor-sharp <i>pugio</i> and <i>gladius</i> preferred by the Roman legions, and they wear their weapons attached to the waist. Their method of murder, however, will not be restricted to the dagger or sword. Should they wish, Herod&#x2019;s soldiers can also use a skull-crushing stone, hurl the baby boys off a cliff en masse, or just wrap their fists around the infants&#x2019; windpipes and strangle them.</p> <p>The cause of death is not important. What matters most is one simple fact: king of the Jews or not, the infant must die.</p>&#x271d; &#x271d; &#x271d; <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, King Herod gazes out a palace window toward Bethlehem, anxiously awaiting confirmation of the slaughter. In the cobbled streets below him, the Roman-appointed king sees the crowded bazaars, where vendors sell everything from water and dates to tourist trinkets and roast lamb. The walled city of some eighty thousand residents packed into less than a single square mile is a crossroads of the eastern Mediterranean. With one sweep of his eyes, Herod can see visiting Galilean peasants, brightly dressed Syrian women, and the foreign soldiers he pays to wage his battles. These men fight extremely well but are not Jews and don&#x2019;t speak a word of the Hebrew language.</p> <p>Herod sighs. Back in his youth, he would never have stood in a window and worried about the future. A great king and warrior such as he would have ordered that a bridle be thrown over his favorite white charger so that he might gallop to Bethlehem and murder the child himself. But Herod is now a man of sixty-nine. His massive girth and incessant medical problems make it physically impossible for him to leave his palace, let alone mount a horse. His bloated face is wreathed in a beard that extends from the bottom of his chin to just below his Adam&#x2019;s apple. On this day, he wears a royal purple Roman-style mantle over a short-sleeved white silk tunic. Normally Herod prefers soft leather leggings that have been stained purple. But today even the gentlest bristle of fabric against his inflamed big toe is enough to make him cry out in pain. So it is that Herod, the most powerful man in Judea, hobbles through the palace barefoot.</p> <p>But gout is the least of Herod&#x2019;s ailments. The king of the Jews, as this nonpracticing convert to the religion likes to be known, is also suffering from lung disease, kidney problems, worms, a heart condition, sexually transmitted diseases, and a horrible version of gangrene that has caused his genitals to rot, turn black, and become infested with maggots&#x2014;thus the inability to sit astride, let alone ride, a horse.</p> <p>Herod has learned how to live with his aches and pains, but these warnings about a new king in Bethlehem are scaring him. Since the Romans first installed him as ruler of Judea more than thirty years ago, Herod has foiled countless plots and waged many wars to remain king. He has murdered anyone who would try to steal his throne&#x2014;and even executed those only suspected of plotting against him. His power over the locals is absolute. No one in Judea is safe from Herod&#x2019;s executions. He has ordered deaths by hanging, stoning, strangulation, fire, the sword, live animals, serpents, beating, and a type of public suicide in which victims are forced to hurl themselves off tall buildings. The lone form of execution in which he has not engaged is crucifixion, that most slow and humiliating of deaths, where a man is flogged and then nailed naked upon a wooden cross in plain sight of the city walls. The Romans are the masters of this brutal art, and they almost exclusively practice it. Herod would not dream of enraging his superiors in Rome by appropriating their favorite form of murder.</p> <p>Herod has ten wives&#x2014;or <i>had</i>, before he executed the fiery Mariamme for allegedly plotting against him. For good measure, he also ordered the deaths of her mother and of his sons Alexander and Aristobulus. Within a year, he will murder a third male offspring. Small wonder that the great Roman emperor Caesar Augustus was rumored to have openly commented, &#x201c;It is better to be Herod&#x2019;s pig than to be his son.&#x201d;</p> <p>But this newest threat, though it comes from a mere infant, is the most dangerous of all. For centuries, Jewish prophets have predicted the coming of a new king to rule their people.&#x2021; They have prophesied five specific occurrences that will take place to confirm the new Messiah&#x2019;s birth.</p> <p>The first is that a great star will rise.</p> <p>The second is that the baby will be born in Bethlehem, the small town where the great King David was born a thousand years before.</p> <p>The third prophecy is that the child must also be a direct descendant of David, a fact that can easily be proven by the temple&#x2019;s meticulous genealogical records.</p> <p>Fourth, powerful men will travel from afar to worship him.</p> <p>Finally, the child&#x2019;s mother must be a virgin.ï¿½</p> <p>What troubles Herod most deeply is that he knows the first two of these to be true.</p> <p>He might be even more distressed to learn that all five have come to pass. The child is from the line of David; powerful men have traveled from afar to worship him; and his teenage mother, Mary, swears that she is still a virgin, despite her pregnancy.</p> <p>He also does not know that the child&#x2019;s name is Yeshua ben Joseph&#x2014;or Jesus, meaning &#x201c;the Lord is salvation.&#x201d;</p> <p>Herod first learns about Jesus from the travelers who have come to worship the baby. These men are called Magi, and they stop at his castle to pay their respects en route to paying homage to Jesus. They are astronomers, diviners, and wise men who also study the world&#x2019;s great religious texts. Among these books is the Tanakh,ï¿½ a collection of history, prophecy, poetry, and songs telling the story of the Jewish people. The wealthy foreigners travel almost a thousand miles over rugged desert, following an extraordinarily bright star that shines in the sky each morning before dawn. &#x201c;Where is the one who has been born the king of the Jews?&#x201d; they demand to know upon their arrival in Herod&#x2019;s court. &#x201c;We see his star in the east and have come to worship him.&#x201d; **</p> <p>Amazingly, the Magi carry treasure chests filled with gold and the sweet-smelling tree resins myrrh and frankincense. These priests are learned, studious men. Theirs is a life of analysis and reason. Herod can conclude only that either the Magi are out of their minds for risking the theft of such a great fortune in the vast and lawless Parthian desert or they truly believe this child to be the new king.</p> <p>A furious Herod summons his religious advisers. As a secular man, he knows little about Jewish prophecies. Herod insists that these high priests and teachers of religious law tell him exactly where to find the new king.</p> <p>The answer comes immediately: &#x201c;In Bethlehem, in Judea.&#x201d;</p> <p>The teachers whom Herod is interrogating are humble men. They wear simple white linen caps and robes. But the bearded Temple priests are a far different story. They dress elaborately, in white-and-blue linen caps with a gold band on the brow, and blue robes adorned in bright tassels and bells. Over their robes they wear capes and purses adorned in gold and precious stones. On a normal day their garb distinguishes them from the people of Jerusalem. But even in his dissipated state, King Herod is the most regal man in the room by far. He continues to hector the teachers and priests. &#x201c;Where is this so-called king of the Jews?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bethlehem, in the land of Judah.&#x201d; They quote verbatim from the words of the prophet Micah, some seven centuries earlier. &#x201c;Out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.&#x201d;</p> <p>Herod sends the Magi on their way. His parting royal decree is that they locate the infant, then return to Jerusalem and tell Herod the child&#x2019;s precise location so that he can venture forth to worship this new king himself.</p> <p>The Magi see through this deceit. They never come back.</p> <p>So it is that time passes and Herod realizes he must take action. From the windows of his fortress palace, he can see all of Jerusalem. To his left rises the great Temple, the most important and sacred building in all Judea. Perched atop a massive stone platform that gives it the appearance of a citadel rather than a simple place of worship, the Temple is a physical embodiment of the Jewish people and their ancient faith. The Temple was first built by Solomon in the tenth century B.C. It was leveled by the Babylonians in 586 B.C., and then the Second Temple was built by Zerubbabel and others under the Persians nearly seventy years later. Herod recently renovated the entire complex and expanded the Temple&#x2019;s size to epic proportions, making it far larger than that of Solomon&#x2019;s. The Temple and its courts are now a symbol not just of Judaism but of the evil king himself.</p> <p>So it is ironic, as Herod frets and gazes toward Bethlehem, that Jesus and his parents have already traveled to Jerusalem twice and paid visits to that great stone fortress, built atop the site where the Jewish patriarch Abraham nearly sacrificed his own son, Isaac. The first visit came eight days after Jesus&#x2019;s birth,&#x2020;&#x2020; so that he might be circumcised. There the child was formally named Jesus, in keeping with the prophecy. The second visit came when he was forty days old. The baby Jesus was brought to the Temple and formally presented to God, in keeping with the laws of the Jewish faith. His father, Joseph, a carpenter, dutifully purchased a pair of young turtledoves to be sacrificed in honor of this momentous occasion.</p> <p>Something very strange and mystical occurred as Jesus and his parents entered the Temple on that day&#x2014;something that hinted that Jesus might truly be a very special child. Two complete strangers, an old man and an old woman&#x2014;neither of whom knew anything about this baby called Jesus or his fulfillment of prophecy&#x2014;saw him from across the crowded place of worship and went to him.</p> <p>Mary, Joseph, and Jesus were traveling in complete anonymity, avoiding anything that would draw attention to them. The old man&#x2019;s name was Simeon, and he was of the belief that he would not die until he laid eyes upon the new king of the Jews. Simeon asked if he might hold the newborn. Mary and Joseph agreed. As Simeon took Jesus into his arms, he offered a prayer to God, thanking him for the chance to see this new king with his own eyes. Then Simeon handed Jesus back to Mary with these words: &#x201c;This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>At that very moment, a woman named Anna&#x2021;&#x2021; also approached. She was an eighty-four-year-old widowed prophetess who spent all her waking hours in the Temple, fasting and praying. Simeon&#x2019;s words were still ringing in Mary&#x2019;s and Joseph&#x2019;s ears when Anna stepped forth and also praised Jesus. She loudly thanked God for bringing this very special baby boy into the world. Then she made a most unusual claim, predicting to Mary and Joseph that their son would free Jerusalem from Roman rule.</p> <p>Mary and Joseph marveled at Simeon&#x2019;s and Anna&#x2019;s words, flattered for the attention as all new parents would be, but also unsure what all this talk about swords and redemption truly meant. They finished their business and departed from the Temple into the bustling city of Jerusalem, both elated and fearful for the life their son might be destined to lead.</p>&#x271d; &#x271d; &#x271d; <p></p> <p>If only Herod had known that Jesus had been so close&#x2014;literally, less than six hundred yards from his throne room&#x2014;his torment could have been relieved. But Jesus and his parents were just three more bodies making their way through the noisy bazaars and narrow, twisting streets en route to the Temple that day.</p> <p>It is a temple that will stand forever as a monument to Herod&#x2019;s greatness&#x2014;or so he believes. Ironically, he is barely welcome inside its walls, thanks to his utter lack of devotion or faith and his ruthlessness in subjugating the Jewish people.</p> <p>Beyond the Temple, on the far side of the Kidron Valley, rises the steep Mount of Olives, where shepherds tend their flocks on the grasses of the limestone-flecked hillsides. Soon will come the Passover feast, bringing with it tens of thousands of Hebrew pilgrims from all around Herod&#x2019;s kingdom, eager to pay good money to purchase those sheep for a sacrificial slaughter in the great Temple.</p> <p>In many ways, the slaughter of the babies in Bethlehem is no different. They are being sacrificed for the good of Herod&#x2019;s rule&#x2014;which is the same as saying they are being murdered in the name of the Roman Empire. Herod is nothing without Rome, a puppet who owes his kingdom completely to that brutal and all-powerful republic. It is his right and duty to propagate its oppressive ways. For Herod&#x2019;s kingdom is different from any other under Rome&#x2019;s iron fist. The Jewish people are an ancient civilization founded upon a belief system that is at odds with Rome&#x2019;s, which worships many pagan deities instead of the one solitary Jewish god.</p> <p>Herod is the intermediary in this precarious relationship. The Romans will hold him accountable for any problems caused by an alleged new king of the Jews. They will not tolerate a ruler they have not themselves chosen. And if the followers of this new &#x201c;king&#x201d; foment revolution, it is certain that the Romans will immediately step in to brutally crush this voice of dissent. Better that Herod handle it himself.</p> <p>Herod cannot see Bethlehem from his palace, but it is roughly six miles away, on the far side of some low green hills. He cannot see the blood flowing in its streets right now, nor hear the wails of the terrified children and their parents. As Herod gazes out from his palace, he does so with a ...</p></p><h2>That ye may believe</h2><p>Here is counsel, comfort, inspiration, and encouragement at its best, flowing as it does from a gifted and creative writer who is rooted in scripture and the restored gospel. This book has an unusual format that leads to exciting reading. Unusual because it "consists of letters written to our grandchildren as if they were older," making good adult reading. Exciting because it allows this talented thinker and writer to range far and wide in the filed of gospel concepts. Though the inquiries he responds to are imaginary, he notes, the concerns they deal with are real enough. They affect us all. And his invigorating answers will inform and delight his many readers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book begins and ends with powerful expressions about the central gospel concept- the Savior and His atonement. In between are more than seventy other stimulating messages of varying lengths, each on a supporting theme: Take time to smell the flowers but keep checking the leaves on the fig tree, the signs of the last days; respect trials- even expect them- as developmental, purifying devices; a fullness of joy is possible, even despite the waywardness of a loved one; develop and appreciate mortal joys- they foreshadow immortality. Here is advice on dealing with doubters, giving and receiving reproof, standing firm amid the turmoil of modern life, growing through self-discipline, seeking the status that endures, speaking up or keeping silent, as appropriate, and much, much more. The reader will sometimes chuckle as life's irony and humor are perceptively discussed. Interest if further enhanced by the author's having incorporated, from his background of wide and deep reading, illuminating examples and quotations from great spirits and great minds that range from Brigham Young to Winston Churchill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As all this combines with apostolic testimony of the gospel that shines through the book's pages, the reader will find that his own conviction is strengthened and enlarged.</p><p></p><h2>What a Ghoul Wants: A Ghost Hunter Mystery</h2><p><i>M.

Even so, Le Guin has written numerous stories with no hint of scientific speculation or fantasy?like the majority of the 18 tales in this collection, many of which first appeared in the New Yorker, Harper's, Playboy and elsewhere during the past 14 years. Set partially in an abortion clinic and steeped in realism, "Standing Ground" is a truthful and difficult story, first published in Ms., about the plight of a teenage girl and her pregnant, retarded mother. On the other end of the spectrum is "Poacher," an inversion of the Sleeping Beauty myth wherein the use of mind and spirit is itself the ultimate reward. Also particularly strong is "Half Past Four," a virtuoso literary exercise that evokes a wide range of emotions as Le Guin rearranges the situations and sensibilities of a small group of characters, focusing primarily on three adults and their relationships to a retarded infant. The collection flows like water: it's sometimes rough and agitated; sometimes playful, as in "Limberlost," in which an author returns to the campground of her youth, now the site of a rustic literary conference; and sometimes reflective, as in the title story, a parable/fairy tale about love and political change in a place where "[t]hey stood on the stones in the lightly falling snow and listened to the silvery, trembling sound of thousands of keys being shaken, unlocking the air, once upon a time." Admirers of fine literature, fantastic or not, will cherish this rich offering. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On the Road Again - A Faith Journey: A Lenten Study for Adults (Thematic Lent Study 2007)</h2><p><p><i>&#x201c;Each year as we move toward Easter, we make a road trip.

Jackson's effective use of spies in war time and of martial law in peace time sparked a debate about the curtailing of civil liberties in the name of national security that continues to this day. Most of all, Jackson was a great motivator who could, with a few carefully selected words and by his own brave example, turn around starved, deserting troops, convincing them to fight. With dramatic scenes of fierce battles and victories, Remini reveals here why Jackson's bold leadership as a general led to his election as President of the United States in 1828.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert V.

Joining the great array of ``Rimbaudians,'' as Borer calls them--the many writers, from the poet's own sister to Enid Starkie and Henry Miller, whom Rimbaud inspired--Borer explores the puzzles and eccentricities of Rimbaud: his fascination with evil; his sensuality; his iconoclasm and rage; his experiments with drugs, love, religion; his restlessness; his crimes--he had a police record in every country he visited and provoked Paul Verlaine, his lover whom he tortured with knives, into shooting him. Despising convention, courtesy, morality (``a weakness of the brain''), glorifying evil and excess, Rimbaud became a permanent symbol of adolescent rebellion before literally escaping from his own identity as the ``visionary'' that he described in the one book he published during his life, an autobiography of his own mind called A Season in Hell. Borer searches for the vestiges of this identity in the adventurer-entrepreneur Rimbaud became--and, in the process, finds the poet in himself. An odd combination of Rimbaud himself, his words and his experiments with form, and the assertive, fragmentary style of the TV documentary on which the book is based--a very challenging read for those uninitiated in Rimbaud and ``Rimbaudrary.'' The translation must have been a trial: What to make of ``his bulimia for reading remained unsated''? -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In a country where patriarchal favoritism and the primacy of sons survived multiple revolutions and an ideological earthquake, this epic novel is first and foremost about women, with the female body serving as the book&#x2019;s central metaphor. The protagonist, Mother, is born in 1900 and married at seventeen into the Shangguan family. She has nine children, only one of whom is a boy&#x2014;the narrator of the book. A spoiled and ineffectual child, he stands in stark contrast to his eight strong and forceful female siblings.<br><br>Mother, a survivor, is the quintessential strong woman who risks her life to save several of her children and grandchildren. The writing is picturesque, bawdy, shocking, and imaginative. The structure draws on the essentials of classical Chinese formalism and injects them with extraordinarily raw and surprising prose. Each of the seven chapters represents a different time period, from the end of the Qing dynasty up through the Japanese invasion in the 1930s, the civil war, the Cultural Revolution, and the post-Mao years. Now in a beautifully bound collectors edition, this stunning novel is Mo Yan&#x2019;s searing vision of twentieth-century China.</p><p><strong></strong>Mo Yan, winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature, was born in 1955 in North Gaomi Township in Shandong Province, an impoverished rural area that is the setting for much of his fiction. Despite the audacity of his writing, he has won virtually every national literary prize, including China&#x2019;s Annual Writer&#x2019;s Prize, its most prestigious award. He is the author of<em> The Garlic Ballads</em>, <em>The Republic of Wine</em>; <em>Shifu, You&#x2019;ll Do Anything for a Laugh</em>; <em>Big Breasts and Wide Hips</em>, and <em>Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out</em>, all published by Arcade, as well as <em>Red Sorghum </em>and <em>Pow!</em>. Mo Yan and his family live in Beijing.<br><br><strong></strong><strong>Howard Goldblatt</strong> taught modern Chinese literature and culture for more than a quarter of a century. He is the foremost translator of modern and contemporary Chinese literature in the West and a former Guggenheim Fellow.This massive novel, which runs well over 500 pages and spans almost the entire 20th century, appears to be Mo Yan's grab for the brass ring, i.e., the Nobel Prize for Literature. The author of innumerable short stories and three previous novels -- most notably Red Sorghum, which was made into a well-regarded and popular film -- turns 50 next year, and even at that relatively early age has long been an important voice in China, where he has spoken out courageously for freedom and individualism, and in the world, where he is properly regarded as representing his country's hopes for unconstrained literary and artistic expression. The Swedish Academy, which leaps at any chance to mix literature with politics, might well find in Mo Yan just the right writer through whom to send a message to the Chinese Communist leadership. <p>According to Howard Goldblatt, Mo's American translator and passionate advocate, Mo has said: "If you like, you can skip my other novels, but you must read Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips. In it I wrote about history, war, politics, hunger, religion, love, and sex." That is no exaggeration. Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips goes for all the marbles. It calls to mind a couple of other novels of fairly recent vintage that attempt to embrace the history of the author's country (Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children) or continent (Gabriel Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude). It calls them to mind, but it falls well short of the heights they achieve. Its ambition is laudable, and its humanity is self-evident, but it only infrequently achieves literary grace or distinction.</p><p>Granted, literary quality in translations is always difficult to appraise fairly unless the reader knows the language being translated, and Chinese is notoriously difficult to render in English. Goldblatt (who teaches Asian studies at Notre Dame) appears to be near-universally regarded as the leading English-language translator of fiction from the Chinese, so presumably he has struck that difficult balance between fidelity to the original and readability in translation. The result is a novel with clear if rather uninspired prose, loose narrative structure and a profusion of characters, many of whom are interesting and strong, but the Western reader has difficulty distinguishing one from the other because of the unfamiliarity of their Chinese proper names. Goldblatt fortunately has supplied a "List of Principal Characters," and I found myself flipping back to it over and over again: Who is Sha Yueliang, who is Sha Zaohua, who is Sima Ting, who is Sima Ku? </p><p>For some reason Goldblatt does not tell us, in his otherwise very helpful introduction, that Mo Yan (which means "don't speak") is the pen name of Guan Moye, about whom you can read much of interest at http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/68238.htm. He was born to a peasant family in Shandong Province in eastern China (which he fictionalizes as Northeast Gaomi County, his version of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County) and, Goldblatt writes, had "little formal schooling before being sent out into the fields to tend livestock and then into factories during the disastrous decade of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)," which he satirizes to stinging effect in this novel. He seems to be almost entirely self-educated; he acknowledges having read and admired the Latin American novelists of "the Boom," but insists that his own country and his own experience are the raw materials from which his work is drawn. </p><p>Among the many convictions of Mo Yan's that surface in Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips, none is more prominent than his passionate feminism. It's easy to be a feminist in the West, but something else altogether in China, where women for centuries have been exploited, undervalued and often despised, where "the cruel reality [was] that for a woman, not getting married was not an option, not having children was not acceptable, and having only daughters was nothing to be proud of. The only road to status in a family was to produce sons." That is a description of attitudes in China between the world wars; more recently women have achieved certain rights and opportunities, but the government's attempt to limit families to one child and the wide availability of Chinese girl babies in the international adoption market make plain that old attitudes linger. In taking such a strong feminist position, Mo is very much against the grain. </p><p>The woman around whom this immense novel revolves is Shangguan Lu, born Xuan'er in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, almost immediately orphaned when German soldiers murdered her father; her mother "had hidden her daughter . . . in a large flour vat before hanging herself from the rafter to preserve her chastity." She grows up under the care of an aunt and uncle, marries the feckless Shangguan Shouxi, a blacksmith who "was as useless as a gob of snot outside the house and totally subservient in front of his mother," as well as useless in the conjugal bed. In order to produce children she must stray, as she does over and over again, coming forth with one girl after another, to a total of seven before her final pregnancy, which yields twins: a blind girl and a son, Jintong ("Golden Boy"), upon whom she dotes and who is the narrator of most of the novel, though occasionally Mo reverts to omniscient narration. </p><p>Jintong is perhaps the novel's principal failure. He is weak, spoiled, "useless, worse than useless," selfish. He is meant to embody masculine weakness by contrast to all the female strength with which he is surrounded as symbolized by the female breasts with which he is obsessed, not as sexual objects but because "the only worthwhile things in my life were breasts and the milk they held." He nurses at his mother's teats, and then at a goat's, until he is well into his teens. When his mother tries to wean him onto a bottle, "the yolk-colored rubber nipple . . . couldn't compare with the real things on the tips of Mother's breasts -- hers were love, hers were poetry, hers were the highest realm of heaven and the rich soil under golden waves of wheat -- nor could it compare with the large, swollen, speckled teats of my milk goat -- hers were tumultuous life, hers were surging passion." </p><p>He is, in short, a momma's boy and a pantywaist, a combination with which a reader may find it very difficult to connect. Obviously Mo intentionally made the novel's principal male character as weak as he is (another leading male character, Sima Ku, a fierce and resourceful warrior, is "a bastard, but he's also a man worthy of the name"), but he gives the reader nothing to care about, except to wish that Jintong would get off the teat and grow up. </p><p>The female characters, though, are almost uniformly terrific, which leaves one to lament that Mo methodically kills most of them off: one who attempts to fly by leaping off a cliff, one who is executed by Red troops, one who is killed by Japanese soldiers during World War II. They die off, but they do so spectacularly and bravely. Unlike Jintong, who barely has the courage to accept a woman's sexual overtures, these women are, in their different ways, warriors. Indeed, readers familiar with Ang Lee's spectacular film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" will feel at moments as if Mo had transported them right into it. </p><p>Mo does heavy drama -- war, violence, natural upheavals -- uncommonly well. Though World War II ended a decade before he was born, no scenes in the novel are more vivid than those involving Japanese brutality against ordinary Chinese civilians and Chinese guerrilla resistance. He gets the Red Guards exactly right, with their ridiculous accusations (posting "notices such as: "Traitor's Family, Landlord Restitution Corps Nest, and Whore's House") and their random, vicious brutality. He's not much kinder to the new China. As one of the younger characters puts it: "No more class, no more struggles. All anyone can see these days is money." </p><p>The sweep of the novel is broad and bold. It's fiction in the grand, triple-decker tradition, Dickens gone to China and finding as much human raw material as England ever offered. If it has flaws, they mostly are those of ambition, of reaching further and higher than the material can bear. There's nothing wrong with that. <br><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

One of the most prolific historians of his generation, Porter wrote and edited about 80 books. In a world of specialization, he was an exception. His first book dealt with the history of geology; subsequently, his attention shifted to 18th-century medicine and the history of psychiatry. But he never was confined by period or subject. In 1994 he published London: A Social History (London: Hamish Hamilton), which was followed three years later by The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity (Hammersmith, London: HarperCollins), an 800-page tome that spanned the centuries from the ancient Greeks to the present. Porter was also a catalyst; he encouraged scholars to ask novel questions and to examine untraditional sources. His works on 18th-century medicine and his emphasis on the need to understand patients as well as physicians opened new horizons. Beyond his scholarly activities, he reached a broad audience through public lectures and radio and television appearances. His dynamic personality, his humor, and his sense of irony appealed to both scholars and the general public. Blood and Guts -- a brief book, running to fewer than 60,000 words -- originated in lecture courses given at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. In breathtaking and fearless fashion, Porter surveys Western medicine from antiquity to the present. The history of medicine, he suggests, is not synonymous with the history of physicians. On the contrary, the subject involves complex interactions of human beings, disease patterns, and healers set within societies and cultures that each have their own unique beliefs. The chapters cover such topics as disease patterns, healers, the investigation of the body, the emergence of the biomedical model of disease, therapeutics, surgery, and the hospital. Nowhere was change linear; heated debates invariably accompanied theory, practice, and discussions dealing with appropriate institutional and structural forms of medicine. In the final chapter Porter assesses the broad sociopolitical and economic implications of the health care industry, which in the United States now accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product yet leaves about 40 million persons without insurance coverage. Although the evolution of medical thinking and practice occurred in an international setting, Porter emphasizes national differences as well as similarities. In Britain, for example, the National Insurance Act of 1911 and the founding of the National Health Service in 1948 ensured that primary care would remain in the hands of generalist family physicians, whose role was to be gatekeepers for hospitals and specialists. In the United States, by contrast, general practice lost out to specialism. In both nations, medical care, increasingly driven by bureaucracy and technology, helped to undermine the element of trust between patient and doctor, thus contributing to the revitalization of alternative medicine. By the end of the 20th century, for example, there were more registered alternative healers in Britain than general practitioners; in the United States there were 425 million visits to providers of unconventional therapy, as compared with 388 million visits to primary care physicians. In such an inclusive and brief book, inevitably some statements are open to challenge. Porter repeats the familiar claim that diseases of affluence, such as cancer and coronary heart disease, result from Western lifestyles that include fatty diets, junk foods, cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. The data supporting such a claim, however, are less than persuasive. With the exception of the connection between lung cancer and smoking, the cause of most cancers remains unknown. Similarly, the relation between coronary heart disease and risk factors is at best murky. Deaths from coronary heart disease rose sharply during the first half of the 20th century, when most of the risk factors mentioned were absent, and fell dramatically in the second half, when they peaked. Porter also repeats the famous statement attributed to Surgeon General William Stewart in 1969 that the war against infectious disease had been won. Stewart never made such a statement, even though many persist in attributing it to him. Those who are knowledgeable about the history of medicine will find relatively little that is new in this brief book, but Blood and Guts is a delightful and informative introduction to an important subject by one of the outstanding scholars of his generation. The book may even lead some readers to follow up by reading Porter's magisterial work, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind. <i>Gerald N.

In this lively account of the artist's life and work, Mary Tompkins Lewis traces Cezanne from his early years in Aix-en-Provence, struggling to become a painter in the face of opposition from his father, through his time in Paris studying the Old Masters and working with the Impressionists, to his later, reclusive years back in Provence, when he produced the pictures that made him the precursor of a new art.<p>But however important Cezanne's work was for later generations, Lewis argues that it can be fully understood only in the context of both the social and historical circumstances of late nineteenth-century France, and the regional aspirations and tensions of Provence. This is the first study of Cezanne to bring biographical, formal and contextual approaches to bear on the artist's full career.

Jack's hand had snaked from beneath the covers, fumbling for the phone. He grunted a sleepy hello, listened for a moment, then sat up suddenly alert.<br><br>"Is it the girls?" Sarah asked as she turned on the bedside lamp. They had dropped the girls off at the University of Montana just a few weeks earlier and Sarah's worst fear was receiving an early-morning call like this. Jack shook his head and Sarah breathed a sigh of relief.<br><br>"It's Julia," Jack said after hanging up, his voice thick with emotion. "She had a fall. I need to go home."<br><br>Now, as their airplane ascended into the blue Montana sky, Sarah settled into her seat and gazed down at the expansive landscape below. The mountains, tipped with white, seemed to burst from the trees, while rivers meandered across the earth and deep lakes glittered in the midmorning September sun. Though she had grown up in Larkspur, she never tired of its beauty and she hated leaving, even for just a short time. She and Jack hadn't strayed from Montana in years, saw no need to travel to exotic lands, to ocean coasts or dry deserts. All they needed they found in their home on Larkspur Lake.<br><br>She looked over at Jack, who was shifting in his seat, trying to find a comfortable position for his long legs. The crosshatched lines that rested at the corners of his eyes had become more pronounced overnight, and two deep grooves above the bridge of his nose extended to his forehead like a ladder of worry. She had seen this same look on his face when the first of their twin daughters, Elizabeth, was born and had waited a full sixty seconds, an eternity, to take her first breath. Saw the same expression when their other daughter, Emma, took a nasty tumble from her bike and came to them crying, her elbow dangling helplessly at her side. She knew that look. Jack was scared.<br><br>She wished there was something that she could say to ease his nerves, but Jack was a reserved man who kept his worries to himself. She reached for his hand and absentmindedly he fiddled with her wedding band, spinning it around and around her finger like a talisman. "When do you think we'll get to Penny Gate?" Sarah asked.<br><br>Jack checked his watch and mentally calculated the distance to the small Iowa town where he grew up. "I'd say we'll get there about seven if we go straight to the hospital. Uncle Hal said they stabilized Julia in the emergency room and now she's in the ICU."<br><br>"From what you've told me about your aunt, if anyone can pull through such a bad fall, it's Julia. Thank God your sister found her so quickly."<br><br>"Yeah, if Amy showed up at the house any later, I don't know if she would still be alive." Jack went silent then, as if lost in thought, focusing intently on the seat in front of him.<br><br>Sarah could hear the worry in his voice. What would they find when they arrived in Penny Gate? Would his aunt be awake and grateful to see him or would she succumb to her injuries and not survive the night? "We'll be there soon," Sarah assured him.<br><br>"You know, it's been twenty years since I've been home. After the accident, I just couldn't go back there. Hal and Julia took us in and treated us as their own, and I couldn't even be bothered to visit in all these years."<br><br>Jack rarely spoke of his life in Penny Gate, of the years before the accident that took the lives of both his parents. He kept those memories well hidden, the only part of himself that was off-limits to Sarah. All she really knew was that on a rainy spring night the year Jack turned fifteen, his mother and father climbed into their rusty old pickup truck and Jack never saw either of them again.<br><br>Jack had been her physical therapist, treating Sarah's injured shoulder after her own car accident, and after twelve painful but productive rehab sessions he announced that he had done all he could for her, at least physical-therapy-wise, then promptly asked her out on a date.<br><br>She remembered the night Jack told her about the accident as if it was burned in her memory. They had been dating for about a month and spent the weekend kayaking on Deer Lake, three hours north of Minneapolis. It was a warm summer night; the sun was beginning to set, a large gilded orb melting into the lake's horizon. They were in no rush to return to shore and laid their paddles across their laps and drifted languidly across the water.<br><br>Sarah, at the front of the kayak, gently waved away mosquitoes that hummed past her ear and asked Jack about the night his parents had died. She wasn't sure why he chose that moment to answer; he had sidestepped her questions so many times before. Perhaps it was because in the rear of the kayak she couldn't see his face. Perhaps it was the remote location; they hadn't seen another boat in hours. The only sound was the gentle slap of water against the side of the kayak. Jack had breathed the details of the story in staccato, short-clipped phrases that seemed to punch the air from his chest: <em>He was drinking again. I should have stopped her. Stopped him. The roads were wet.</em><br><br>Sarah wanted to turn and reach for Jack but forced herself to remain facing forward in the kayak, afraid that any movement would cause him to stop talking.<br><br><em>He flipped the truck. Upside down in a cornfield. Killed instantly.</em><br><br>Jack's breath came out in jagged chuffs and Sarah could tell that he was crying. Slowly, carefully, as one might to a skittish animal, she reached behind her and found Jack's hand.<br><br>A year later they were married, she quit her job as a reporter and they moved to Larkspur to begin a family. In the past twenty years Sarah had wanted to ask Jack so many questions. Not just about the accident and the years that followed, but about what his life was like before his parents died. Simple questions. Did he look more like his mother or his father? What books did she read to him before bedtime or did she call him by a pet name? Did his father teach him to bait a hook or skip rocks across a pond? But every time she broached the subject, Jack would find a way to avoid the conversation. He wouldn't let her in.<br><br>Jack released Sarah's hand and ran his fingers through his gray-flecked hair, a nervous gesture that she knew he would repeat a hundred times before they landed. "I shouldn't have waited so long to come back," he murmured.<br><br>Jack jiggled his leg up and down, striking the back of the seat with his knee. The man in front of him turned around and glowered with irritation. Jack didn't notice.<br><br>"I'm sure they understand," Sarah said, laying a hand on his leg to still it. But she wondered if Jack's aunt and uncle truly understood how the boy they took into their home could stay away for nearly two decades.<br><br>"I should have called her back." Jack's voice caught and he cleared his throat. "It just slipped my mind and I knew she'd call again in a few days." Jack's aunt, without fail, called the house each Sunday evening to check in and catch up on the events of their week. But the previous Sunday they were out for a walk and had missed Julia's call. She had left a message on their machine, but it was late when they returned home and Jack had forgotten to call back the following day.<br><br>When they came home and listened to the message, Sarah had thought she detected a shakiness in Julia's voice, a tremor that made her think of Parkinson's. At the time she had dismissed it, but now she wondered if she should have said something to Jack.<br><br>"Do you think that Julia sounded different the last few times she called?" Sarah asked, pulling her cardigan more tightly around herself to stave off the plane's chilly temperature.<br><br>Jack narrowed his eyes as if mentally shuffling through recent conversations with his aunt. "I don't think so. What do you mean?"<br><br>Sarah hesitated. "I'm not sure. Has Hal said anything about any health concerns?"<br><br>"No, but that doesn't mean she hasn't had any problems," Jack admitted. He tilted his head back against the headrest and stared up at the plane's ceiling. "I can't believe they still live in that house," he said, changing the subject. "It's too big for two people. And those steps. They're so steep. I tripped down them all the time when I was a kid. I just can't believe that someone hasn't had a bad fall before now. The place is a death trap."<br><br>Jack crossed his arms in front of his chest and burrowed more deeply into his seat. "We used to go to this pond," he said as she slid her hand through his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. The comforting scent of his shaving cream and the starch used to iron his shirt filled her nose. "Aunt Julia would pack these elaborate picnics. Strawberries that we'd spent hours picking and pickled herring on crackers, cheese with names we couldn't pronounce and her homemade bread." Jack's voice sounded far away and Sarah hung on his words. "Then we'd all climb into the back of Uncle Hal's truck and drive down the old mud road to the pond. We'd sit on the bank and fish for hours and would end up with just a few bluegills, a bass if we were lucky. Julia would make a big deal out of each one we caught, though, clapping her hands and jumping up and down."<br><br>Sarah thought about the times they had taken Elizabeth and Emma fishing. The girls squealing over the wiggling worms that Jack used to bait their hooks. Their delight at Jack pretending to buckle beneath the weight of their catches.<br><br>"Sometimes I can still taste those strawberries." Jack smiled sadly and Sarah squeezed his hand.<br><br>"It must be hard going back," Sarah reflected. "Lots of memories."<br><br>He nodded tentatively, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. "Everything seemed so simple then. Easier somehow." Jack turned to the window then and looked out at the far-reaching landscape below. The world was endless from this vantage point, full of infinite wonder and possibility, and Jack drifted off in thought as he took in the view.<br><br>"I remember on stormy summer nights," he started, his voice tinged with sadness. "When the power would go out, my mom would scavenge through the cupboards and drawers looking for flashlights." Sarah's breath caught in her chest. Jack never spoke about his parents. Ever.<br><br>"Amy and I would grab the clean sheets from the clothesline just before the rain began to fall. Then we'd throw them over the furniture to make forts. We'd pretend the flashlights were our campfire and tell each other stories..."<br><br>Jack looked as if he was going to say more but instead he rubbed his hand across his mouth as if wiping away the thought. He turned back from the window and leaned his head against the headrest and closed his eyes.<br><br>Sarah wanted to press for more, but she knew this fleeting moment of reminiscence was over.<br><br>As the airplane carried them away from the life they had made together, she watched Jack doze. Behind his closed eyelids she knew that a thousand secret memories drifted. She wanted him to let her in, to know that he was safe. Safe with her. Maybe she couldn't erase all the sadness and bitterness he was carrying. But she could be there for him and help him through the pain.<br><br>Despite the sad circumstances of their trip to Penny Gate, Sarah was looking forward to seeing the town Jack grew up in. She wanted to drive along the roads that he once traveled, to see the bedroom that he once slept in, to spend time with his family, whom she had only gotten to know over the years through phone calls and birthday cards. She thought it might bring her closer to him.<br><br>She let Jack rest until the pilot's voice filled the airplane cabin, announcing their impending arrival in Chicago. The fasten-seat-belt light blinked on, and she lightly nudged Jack awake. Down below, the blue expanse of Lake Michigan was edged by miles of skyscrapers. Each drop in altitude was jarring, and Sarah's stomach churned. She reached for Jack's hand and closed her eyes, squeezing his fingers tightly until finally the wheels touched the runway.<br><br>They had only fifteen minutes to get to their gate in time to catch their connecting flight to the small airport near Penny Gate, and Sarah scurried to keep up with Jack's long strides as they wove their way through crowds of travelers, her carry-on bag bumping along behind her.<br><br>When they arrived at their gate, they joined the line of passengers to board their connecting flight. Jack quickly called Hal for an update on Julia's condition.<br><br>"She hasn't woken up yet," he reported grimly when he hung up the phone. "She's back from X-ray and she has a skull fracture, a broken pelvis and both arms are fractured."<br><br>Sarah handed her boarding pass to the gate agent. "That's terrible. Does she need surgery?"<br><br>"I don't know. Not yet, anyway. They're watching her closely to make sure there isn't any bleeding on her brain."<br><br>They were the last of the fifty passengers to board the full flight. Because of their late booking Sarah's seat was three rows behind Jack and across the aisle.<br><br>It was just a short thirty-minute flight to the small regional airport near Penny Gate, and as they got closer to their destination, Sarah watched from afar as Jack seemed to grow more and more restless. His foot tapped nervously and he kept checking his watch. Sarah knew that a million thoughts were banging around Jack's head. He hadn't seen his aunt and uncle in twenty years. How would they receive him? With open arms or cold reservation? Jack was returning to the town where he was born and raised but whose roads had taken his parents away from him. Anxiety seemed to radiate from his body and Sarah wanted to go to him, to reassure him that everything was going to be okay, and if it wasn't she would be right there beside him.<br><br>Sarah peered out the window as they descended. Jack was right. He had told her that Iowa had a beauty all its own, and the landscape was a patchwork of verdant greens, golden yellows and rich browns.<br><br>When they landed, Jack waited for Sarah at the end of the jet bridge. "Are you okay?" Sarah asked with concern. His skin had taken on a sickly hue.<br><br>"Just a little airsick," Jack explained as they went in search of a rental car.<br><br></p><h2>Bargello Magic; How to Design Your Own</h2><p>Bargello is a type of needlepoint embroidery consisting of upright flat stitches laid in a mathematical pattern to create motifs.

You will just have to invent a new category,&#x201d; Lesley Blanch wrote about <i>Journey into the Mind&#x2019;s Eye</i>, a book that remains as singularly adventurous and intoxicating now as when it first came out in 1968.<br> &nbsp;<br> Russia seized Lesley Blanch when she was still a child. A mysterious traveler&#x2014;swathed in Siberian furs, bearing Fabergï¿½ eggs and icons as gifts along with Russian fairy tales and fairy tales of Russia&#x2014;came to visit her parents and left her starry-eyed. Years later the same man returned to sweep her off her feet. Her love affair with the Traveller, as she calls him, transformed her life and fueled an abiding fascination with Russia and Russian culture, one that would lead her to dingy apartments reeking of cabbage soup and <i>piroshki </i>on the outskirts of Paris in the 1960s, and to Siberia and beyond.</p><p><b>Lesley Blanch&nbsp;</b>(1904&#x2013;2007) was born in west London.&nbsp;From 1922 to 1924 she studied painting at the Slade School of&nbsp;Art and worked steadily as an illustrator and commercial artist&nbsp;for the next decade, designing book jackets as well as costumes&nbsp;and sets for the theater and the ballet. After writing for several&nbsp;British magazines, Blanch turned to journalism full-time, and&nbsp;in 1937 she was named the features editor of British&nbsp;<i>Vogue</i>. She&nbsp;left the magazine in 1945, the same year she married the French&nbsp;novelist and diplomat Romain Gary. The couple moved to Bulgaria;&nbsp;Blanch would never reside in the United Kingdom again. Over&nbsp;the next two decades, they were posted to the Balkans, Switzerland,&nbsp;and the United States. In 1963, Gary divorced her to marry the&nbsp;actress Jean Seberg. Blanch traveled to Russia, Turkey, Central&nbsp;Asia, Iran, and North Africa, researching what would become&nbsp;twelve books. They include the biographies&nbsp;<i>The Wilder Shores of</i>&nbsp;<i>Love&nbsp;</i>(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Sabres of Paradise&nbsp;</i>(1960), and&nbsp;<i>Pierre Loti: Portrait</i>&nbsp;<i>of an Escapist&nbsp;</i>(1983); and one novel,&nbsp;<i>The Nine-Tiger Ma&nbsp;</i>(1965).&nbsp;Her memoirs&nbsp;<i>On the Wilder Shores of Love: A Bohemian Life&nbsp;</i>(2015) were published posthumously, along with a companion&nbsp;volume,&nbsp;<i>Far to Go and Many to Love: People and Place&nbsp;</i>(2017).&nbsp;She died in the south of France at the age of 103.<br><br><b>Georgia de Chamberet</b> is an editor, translator, and journalist.

She is the literary executor of the estate of Lesley Blanch.&#x201c;Blanch&#x2019;s brilliance lies in her honesty about the subjectivity of her work.

As the Haywards point out, "successful gardens grow naturally out of their owners; great garden design is honest, authentic, and unself-conscious." Gordon explains how aspects of his and Mary's lives are woven into their garden, but also how those aspects remain firmly fixed in universal design principles that apply to every garden. With the practical advice and achievable aims that make his other books so rewarding, Hayward lets readers in on the secrets that make his garden outstanding. Almost 200 stunning photographs specially commissioned for the book show key garden views in all four seasons, giving readers a rare look at a year in a garden. Before-and-after shots, detailed garden maps, and plant lists are included. 200 photographs</p><p><p><strong>Gordon Hayward</strong>, an acclaimed garden designer and lecturer, is the author of five previous books.

The land outside their old Vermont farmhouse was once overrun with brambles, buried beneath abandoned cars and hidden under rotted mulch. Together, the Haywards designed a set of connected yards and gardens&#x2014;complete with sitting and dining areas, water features, topiaries and outdoor sculpture&#x2014;that mixed the indigenous New England landscape with Mary's English upbringing. This is not a project-by-project how-to book but rather a detailed look at the techniques the Haywards used to create their own gorgeous garden. Their methods promise to help amateur landscape designers create spaces that are unique, personal and harmonious with the surroundings. Using their own garden as an example, the Haywards demonstrate the importance of controlling edges, lines, transitions and focal points. Two hundred color photographs, including seasonal shots and before-and-afters, offer proof of the effectiveness of the Haywards's intuitive design philosophy. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She captures the beauty and variety of parrots - and their close relations, macaws and cockatoos - in a series of paintings and sketches. The artist also explains how she became fascinated by parrots.</p><p>The hyacinthine macaw and the umbrella cockatoo are among the more flamboyant subjects of this poster-size collection, which comprises 26 meticulous renderings of tropical birds executed in oils, watercolors, pen and ink, and gouache. A keen eye, sure hand, facility with color and evident fascination with exotic aviary make British artist Butterworth highly proficient in her craft. Disappointingly, the extremely accurate, photorealistic studies lack the originality or expressiveness that might elevate them to a more enduring art form. While readers with a specific interest in birds should welcome this slim volume as a fine visual catalogue of the subtle variations in feather formation and coloring that distinguish over two-dozen parrot-related species, few plates stand on compositional integrity. The majority, suggesting pages from a naturalist's notebooks, are likely to leave a lay audience uninspired and thus dissatisfied by the absence of an accompanying text beyond Butterworth's brief, introductory remarks about parrots and their classification, extinction and personal appeal. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Accounting for Non-Accountants: The Fast and Easy Way to Learn the Basics (Quick Start Your Business)</h2><p><p><strong>A Quick, Compact, and Easy-to Understand Resource for Non-Accountants</strong></p> <p><em>Accounting for Non-Accountants </em>is the must-have guide for all of us who have never taken an accounting class, are mystified by accounting jargon, and have no clue about balance sheets, income statements, or statements of cash flows.</p> <p>Whether you own a business, plan on starting one, or just want to control your own assets, you'll find everything you need to know:</p> <p>How to prepare and use financial statements</p> <p>How to manage budgets</p> <p>How to deal with audits and auditors</p> <p>How to control cash flows</p> <p>How to use accounting ratios to interpret financial statements</p> <p><em>For entrepreneurs or anyone who needs to rush up on accounting fast, this book will have you up and running in no time.</em></p> <p><em>"A definite must-have for any business owner!"</em><br> &#x2014;Julie A.

The accountant's job is to provide the information needed to run a business as efficiently as possible while maximizing profits and keeping costs low.<br> <em>Quick </em>Tip<br> Finding an Accountant: Hiring a professional and ethical accountant to aid in your business operations can be critical to the success of your company.Meet with a few accountants before making a final choice so that you know your options and can select one whose experience and work style will be best suited to your needs and the needs of your business. Local chapters of your state societies of CPAs offer referral services that can help with this.</p> <p>Accounting plays a role in businesses of all sizes. Your kids' lemonï¿½ade stand, a one-person business, and a multinational corporation all use the same basic accounting principles. Accounting is legislated; it affects your taxes; even the president plays a role in how accounting affects you.</p> <p>Accounting is the language of business. It is the process of recordï¿½ing, classifying, and summarizing economic events through certain documents or financial statements. Like any other language, accountï¿½ing has its own terms and rules. To understand how to interpret and use the information accounting provides, you must first understand this language. Understanding the basic concepts of accounting is essential to success in business.</p> <p>Different types of information furnished by accountants are shown in figure 1.1 on the next page.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.1: Types of Information Provided by Accountants</strong></p> <p>ï¿½ Information prepared exclusively by people within a company (managers, employees, or owners) for their own use.<br> ï¿½ Financial information required by various government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).<br> ï¿½ General information about companies provided to people outï¿½side the firm such as investors, creditors, and labor unions.</p> <p><strong>Accounting and Bookkeeping</strong></p> <p>Bookkeeping procedures and bookkeepers record and keep track of the business transactions that are later used to generate finanï¿½cial statements. Most bookkeeping procedures have been systemï¿½atized, and, in many cases, can be handled by computer programs. Bookkeeping is a very important part of the accounting process, but it is just the beginning. There is currently no certification required to become a bookkeeper in the United States.</p> <p>Accounting is the process of preparing and analyzing financial stateï¿½ments based on the transactions recorded through the bookkeeping process. Accountants are usually professionals who have completed at least a bachelor's degree in accounting, and often have passed a profesï¿½sional examination, like the Certified Public Accountant Examination, the Certified Management Accountant Examination, or the Certified Fraud Auditor Examination.</p> <p>Accounting goes beyond bookkeeping and the recording of economic information to include the summarizing and reporting of this informaï¿½tion in a way that is meant to drive decision making within a business. </p> <p><strong>Who Uses Accounting Information?</strong></p> <p>In the world of business, accounting plays an important role to aid in making critical decisions. The more complex the decision, the more detailed the information must be. Individuals and companies need difï¿½ferent kinds of information to make their business decisions. <br> Let's start with you as an individual. Why would you be interested in accounting? Accounting knowledge can help you with investing in the stock market, applying for a home loan, evaluating a potential job, balancing a checkbook, and starting a personal savings plan, among other things.</p> <p>Managers within a business also use accounting information daily to make decisions, although most of these managers are not accounï¿½tants. Some of the decisions they might make for which they will use accounting information are illustrated in figure 1.2</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.2: Areas in Which Managers Use Accounting Information</strong></p> <p>ï¿½ Marketing (Which line of goods should the company emphasize?)<br> ï¿½ Production (Should the company produce its goods in the United States or open a new plant in Mexico?)<br> ï¿½ Research and Development (How much money should be set aside for new product development?)<br> ï¿½ Sales (Should the company expand the advertising budget and take money away from some other part of the marketing budget?)<br> Without the proper accounting information these types of decisions would be very difficult, if not impossible, to make.</p> <p>Bankers continually use accounting information. They are in the business of taking care of your money and making money with your money, so they absolutely must make good decisions. Accounting is fundamental to their decision-making process. Figure 1.3 looks at some of the decisions bankers make using accounting information.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.3: Areas in Which Bankers Use Accounting Information</strong></p> <p>ï¿½ Granting loans to individuals and companies<br> ï¿½ Investing clients' money<br> ï¿½ Setting interest rates<br> ï¿½ Meeting federal regulations for protecting your money<br> Government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) base their regulation enforcement and compliance on the accounting information they receive.</p> <p><strong>Accountability in Accounting </strong></p> <p>A business's financial statements can also be of great interest to other members of the local or national community. Labor groups might be interested in what impact management's financial decisions have on their unions and other employees. Local communities have an interest in how a business's financial decisions (for example, layoffs or plant closings) will impact their citizens. <br> As the economy becomes more complex, so do the transactions within a business, and the process of reporting them to various users and making them understandable becomes more complex as well. A solid knowledge of accounting is helpful to individuals, managers, and business owners who are making their decisions based on the information accounting documents provide.</p> <p><strong>Financial Statements</strong></p> <p>Accountants supply information to people both inside and outside the firm by issuing formal reports that are called financial statements. </p> <p>The financial statements are usually issued at least once a year. In many cases they are issued quarterly or more often where necesï¿½sary. A set of rules, called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), govern the preparation of the financial statements. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles has been defined as a set of objecï¿½tives, conventions, and principles to govern the preparation and presentation of financial statements. These rules can be found in volumes of documents issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other regulatory bodies. In chapter 2 we look at some of the overriding principles of accounting as they apply to all businesses and individuals.</p></p><h2>Risking the Forbidden Game: Maude Cary (Trailblazer Books #38)</h2><p>Trailblazer Books makes history exciting and relevant for both boys and girls.

There is no God but Allah!" </p><p>The morning call to prayer already? Jamal sat bolt upright on the soft rugs and cushions that served as his bed and squinted at his uncle Samir&#x2019;s bed in the semi-dark room. Empty. </p><p>Jamal groaned and felt around for his trousers and cloth shoes. Why hadn&#x2019;t he heard Uncle Samir leave for prayer? He had wanted to get up in time to grab a handful of dates and drink some water before the gray fingers of dawn revealed the difference between a black thread and a white thread&#x2014;the traditional way in the Muslim world to tell when another day of fasting had begun during the month of Ramadan. Now there would be nothing to eat or drink until nightfall. </p><p>Winding his cloth sash around his already rumbling belly, Jamal hurried out on the balcony that ringed the second floor of rooms above the open courtyard of the Isaam home. The household was quiet. His father, grandfather, and uncle were probably already at the mosque where his father led prayers five times a day. His younger sisters were probably still asleep&#x2014;still "babies" needing to be cared for by their mother. </p><p>Jamal hurried down the steps to the lower courtyard, padded across the cool tiles and through the dark hall to the front door. It wasn&#x2019;t easy not to eat or drink all day long during Ramadan, but he was twelve now, no longer a child for whom exceptions could be made. Well, he&#x2019;d just have to tough it out till his family broke the fast at nightfall . . . but all the more reason to play The Game today. It helped distract his mind from his empty stomach. </p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of Jamal&#x2019;s mouth as he slipped out the door and ran down the narrow street to the mosque. No one else knew about The Game except his friend Hameem. It all started a couple weeks back when the two boys, playing along the river that flowed down the mountain and watered the town of Sefrou, had found a military canteen stuck in the mud of the riverbank. . . . </p><p>Jamal snatched up the canteen, looking around to see if anyone had seen him. One of the French soldiers occupying the town must have dropped it. </p><p>Hameem&#x2019;s eyes grew wide as Jamal dipped the canteen in the cold, rushing river, then raised it to his lips to drink. "What are you doing, foolish boy! That belongs to the infidels!" </p><p>Jamal, a wiry contrast to the stocky Hameem, shrugged. "it&#x2019;s mine now." </p><p>"But if they catch you with it, they will think you are a thief!" </p><p>Jamal considered. He knew the rules. French property was French property and should be returned to the commanding officer. But why should he help the French? The French didn&#x2019;t belong in Sefrou&#x2014;or anywhere in Morocco, for that matter. That&#x2019;s what Uncle Samir said. Jamal&#x2019;s uncle agreed with the rebel tribes out in the desert who refused to accept the Treaty of Fez the sultan had signed in 1912, which made Morocco a French Protectorate. For the most part, French, Arab, African, and Jew mingled side by side in the walled cities and towns along Morocco&#x2019;s fertile coastal plains. But the wild Berber tribes&#x2014;who barely accepted the sultan&#x2019;s authority, much less a foreign power&#x2014;kept the spirit of rebellion alive. One day Morocco would be independent once more. </p><p>Jamal decided. "It&#x2019;s my trophy&#x2014;the spoil of war!" He held the canteen high. </p><p>Hameem sneered. "Do you think your uncle will let you bring that into your house? Your mother will make you wash your hands and say ten prayers of penitence." </p><p>That was true, too. The sultans of Morocco might be pro-European, with their phonographs and railroads and electric lights. And ordinary Muslims tolerated and cooperated with their French "protectors." But many devout Muslims would not allow anything belonging to the infidels in that most sacred place, their homes. </p><p>Jamal pulled Hameem down into the scrubby bushes, where they could not be seen by the women washing clothes in the river. His dark eyes shone with an idea. "Hameem! We can pretend we are rebels, fighting alongside the Desert Prince." Uncle Samir had often held the boys spellbound with stories about the exploits of Abd el-Krim, the notorious rebel leader among the Berber tribes. "It will be a contest&#x2014;just between you and me&#x2014;to see who can collect the most things belonging to the enemy." Jamal looked at Hameem&#x2019;s dubious face. I dare you! Here&#x2014;you can have the canteen to start your collection. Now you&#x2019;re ahead. But I&#x2019;m going to win! </p><p>And so The Game had started. Already Jamal had a plastic comb, a leather strap from an officer&#x2019;s horse, two empty bullet casings, and a metal fork in his treasure box, hidden under the bed pillows in his room. The boys had agreed on a point system: one point for something found; five points for something taken from the buildings the French occupied at the far end of Sefrou; and ten points for something lifted right off a French soldier. </p><p>As Jamal slipped into the big open room of the mosque where his father was leading the morning prayers, his mind was already plotting how he could add to his collection after school. But catching the disapproving look in his grandfather&#x2019;s eye, Jamal quickly washed his hands for the ritual cleansing, then slipped to his knees facing the mihrab, the niche in the far wall that pointed the way to Mecca, the Holy City.</p></p><h2>Golfing with God: A Novel of Heaven and Earth</h2><p>Herman "Hank" Fins-Winston was a pro golfer destined for greatness.

But as they play the heavenly courses both in paradise and back on earth, Hank comes to realize that what began as a golf lesson has become much more, and that rather than teaching God about the game, it is he himself who is learning the lessons&#x2014;about fearing failure, about second chances, about the connectedness of all living things, about not taking the next breath for granted, and about our God-given ability to improve ourselves&#x2014;one stroke at a time. <br> <br> Funny and uplifting, <i>Golfing with God</i> is a beautifully realized novel that takes the reader on one ordinary man's most unexpected passage.</p><h2>Dwarfs (Warhammer)</h2><p>The big book of Dwarves<p>The dwarfs are a stoic and long-lived race.

Amos Yong&#39;s book itself displays the &#39;robust sense of discernment&#39; that he asks all of us to exercise in our engagement with non-Christian religions.&#34;&#34; --RICHARD J. MOUW, Fuller Theological Seminary &#34;&#34;Finally, a Spirit-based theology of religions that takes the Spirit seriously! Drawing on his Pentecostal roots, Yong offers guidelines for discerning the voice of the Spirit in other traditions-a voice that may call us to unexpected christological conclusions. This is truly a pioneering work that opens new theological paths but modestly recognizes that there is still much to explore.&#34;&#34; --PAUL F. KNITTER, Xavier University &#34;&#34;Few areas in theology are as complex, controversial, and urgent as theology of religions. Amos Yong has advanced the discussion significantly with his creative and sophisticated proposal for a pneumatological theology of religions. While undoubtedly controversial, Yong&#39;s proposal frames the issues in fresh ways and suggests new options for an evangelical theology of religions.&#34;&#34; --Harold Netland, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School &#34;&#34;With scholarly rigor and intellectual acumen, Yong&#39;s theology takes seriously and appreciatively the diversity of the work of the universal Spirit in the cultures and religious communities of the world. His position is fully evangelical but is richly informed by his Pentecostal roots and context. He sets this Pentecostal-evangelical theology of religions in the center of the ongoing discussion, not only among evangelicals, but also in the whole church.&#34;&#34; --John B. Cobb Jr., Claremont School of Theology and Claremont Graduate Schools &#34;&#34;An insightful theological reflection on the place of world religions within the broader framework of Christian theology. Yong provides a theological basis for everyday interaction with members of other religions and an understanding of other religious traditions in the providence of God.

WINNER OF THE 1995 BOOKER PRIZE. 1918, the closing months of the war. Army psychiatrist William Rivers is increasingly concerned for the men who have been in his care - particularly Billy Prior, who is about to return to combat in France with young poet Wilfred Owen. As Rivers tries to make sense of what, if anything, he has done to help these injured men, Prior and Owen await the final battles in a war that has decimated a generation ... The Ghost Road is the Booker Prize-winning account of the devastating final months of the First World War. &#39;An extraordinary tour de force. I&#39;m convinced that the trilogy will win recognition as one of the few real masterpieces of late twentieth-century British fiction&#39; Jonathan Coe &#39;Powerful, deeply moving&#39; Barry Unsworth, Sunday Times &#39;Harrowing, original, unforgettable&#39; Independent &#39;A triumph&#39; Sunday Times Other titles in the trilogy: Regeneration The Eye in the Door</p><p>Pat Barker was born in Yorkshire and began her literary career in her forties, when she took a short writing course taught by Angela Carter. Encouraged by Carter to continue writing and exploring the lives of working class women, she sent her fiction out to publishers. Thirty-five years later, she has published fifteen novels, including her masterful Regeneration Trilogy, been made a CBE for services to literature, and won awards including the Guardian Fiction Prize and the UK&#39;s highest literary honour, the Booker Prize. She lives in Durham and her new novel, The Silence of the Girls, will be published by Hamish Hamilton in August 2018.When Billy Prior returns to France for the fourth time in September of 1918, it&#39;s like coming home. He does so against everyone&#39;s advice, but when he watches the sun rise slowly after the Battle of Joncourt, he realizes why he couldn&#39;t have stayed back. And mysteriously, so do we. Peter Firth&#39;s reading captures perfectly Barker&#39;s tragic mix of pity and apotheosis. An accomplished British actor, Firth is at once the cynical, but savvy, Prior, the stammering Professor Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), soft-spoken Dr. Rivers, all with transparent ease. His unerring sense of character and tone recreates the bitter irony of that last push in 1918 when so many died so needlessly. For Barker, these last dead, though they sour the trumpet of victory, are war&#39;s only winners. At the end Firth&#39;s silence becomes eloquent. P.E.F. An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner.

Currently president of the American Crime Writers League, she lives in Arkansas.Fans of the Hess stories set in Maggody, Arkansas (Strangled Prose, etc.), will readily conjure up the potential for havoc when a sleazy Hollywood crew arrives to film Wild Cherry Wine, another of their not-so-soft-porn productions. What Arly Hanks, the town's female police chief, doesn't bargain for is the string of murders that soon follows. First to go is 50-ish, one-time big-box-office Kitty Kaye, stabbed to death in the motel room that she shared with character actor-husband Buddy Meredith. He has disappeared. So has cameraman ``Fuzzy'' Indigo, his nickname indicating his perpetual alcoholic fog. Hal Desmond, the crew's decadent, boorish, coke- addicted, blackmailing director, is the next victim. Gwenneth D'Amourre, his sometime bedmate, has also joined the vanishing act. All this--plus a local arsonist, a sneaky moonshiner, and Arly's instant attraction to actor Anderson St. James (who has an unsolved murder in his past)--keep her and the town in turmoil until Arly's clever sleuthing gets to the bottom of it all. Some sly, funny barbs at Hollywood pretensions enliven the familiar foibles of Maggody's goofy citizens--and provide another cheerful chapter in this lighthearted series. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

After serving as a combat medic in the Pacific during World War II, Coldsmith served as a physician in Emporia, Kansas, until 1988, when he closed his office to devote himself to writing. Coldsmith and his wife, Edna, maintained a small ranching operation, and together raised cattle, Appaloosa horses, and five daughters, not necessarily in that order.</p>The Elk-Dog Heritage<br><i>1</i><i>The old warrior</i> watched as his nephews clumsily began to skin the antelope. He was uneasy, because they had drifted farther into the country of the enemy than he had intended. What had started as a pleasant hunt to teach the sons of his sister was now a threatening situation. He glanced apprehensively at the fringe of brush along the rimrock. The antelope had fallen in the worst area he could imagine. They must butcher rapidly and retreat to safer country.He straightened to get a better look at the dangerous fringe of cover above them. Was that a trace of motion that he detected? How the old man wished that his eyes were as keen as when he was the age of the two youngsters before him.Something plucked against his shirt like a thrown rock, and he glanced down in alarm. He was startled to see protruding from his chest the feathered end of an arrow. Still, his senses refused to accept its significance. A great feeling of weakness came over him and he sank to his knees, the pain of the blow finally reaching his consciousness.The two youngsters looked around in alarm. He motioned for them to run, as three armed warriors sprang from the rocks on the hill and came bounding toward them. The younger boy dashed toward the horses, grabbing a dangling rein and swinging nimbly astride.The other boy stayed just a moment too long at the side of his dying uncle. The other horses, alarmed by the sudden movements,leaped into a canter with their companion. The youngster still on foot made one futile grab at his horse's head. The rein burned through his fingers, and the horses were gone in a flurry of dust. He turned to face his attackers. He was unarmed, having laid aside his weapons to attend to the antelope. Even his skinning knife had been dropped in the excitement. He looked around. Not even a rock or a stick was available.The three now surrounded him, young men little older than himself. One stepped forward and slapped him across the face with open palm. Counting honors by striking the enemy, he knew.He had given up all hope of survival. The best he could hope for now was to die with dignity. Another of the enemy youths sprang and struck at him. He snatched at the other's weapon, but missed. Too bad, they would be more careful now. Vaguely, he wished that his captors would not feel it necessary to count too many honors today before getting on with it. It might be a very long day.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>HEADS OFF, ONCE JUAN GARCIA, SON OF A SPANISH NOBLEMAN, sat comfortably before his lodge. He wriggled his shoulder against the willow backrest, and puffed slowly on the stone pipe. It was a beautiful spring day, and he was amused by the antics of his small son, Eagle, playing in the lodge doorway. Heads Off watched the lithe grace of his wife, the Tall One, as she moved efficiently around the fire, broiling a fat slab of hump ribs.He could become easily aroused at any time by merely watching the lithe movements of her long body for a moment.The girl glanced up at him and smiled, reading his thoughts. Their relationship had been a perfect one. Heads Off had never been aware of any marriage so meaningful in the far-off land of his birth.He told himself that his reasons for remaining with the People were primarily based on accident--an injury, a pregnant mare which had been unable to travel, a broken lance point. Still, in the depths of his soul, he knew the truth. His primary reasons revolved around this slim girl and her family.He could still scarcely believe that he had assumed the chieftainship of this band. There had been no leader surviving after the Great Battle, and the young warriors had asked him for leadership. Only with the help and counsel of his father-in-law, the Coyote, and the aging medicine man, White Buffalo, could he have accomplished it. And now, accepted in this position by the chiefs of the other bands in the Big Council, he had become more confident. Almost arrogant, if the truth were known.He would long remember the manner in which his arrogance was shattered.Hearing a commotion, Heads Off turned to look among the lodges at the edge of the camp. Three riders were approaching, singing and shouting and leading two more horses. His practiced horseman's eye immediately recognized that he had seen neither of the led horses before. This, even before he identified the riders.The one in the lead was a cocky young man who had attracted his notice before. He had been sullen and inattentive during instruction sessions as a member of the Rabbit Society. Despite all his inattention, the boy had proved himself a passable horseman, though Heads Off despaired over his lack of discipline. What was his name, the chief tried to remember. The other boys had given him a nickname that had stuck. It had had to do with his unpleasant disposition. Ah, that was it! The youth was called the Badger. That animal was surly and aggressive, and the name fit very well.Heads Off smiled at the appropriate way the People acquired their names. His own had been bestowed on him the first day hewas found by the People. Sick and injured, he had removed his soldier's helmet, but to the observers he appeared to take off his head. The joke had been on the scouts of the People, but the name had stuck. Few probably remembered the origin of the name, but it now seemed perfectly appropriate to the former Juan Garcia.Badger was closer now, and Heads Off could see that he was brandishing weapons above his head, shouting and singing as he rode.An uneasy feeling of alarm nudged at the young chiefs consciousness. He could not exactly identify the reason for his apprehension, but it was there. The irritating thing nagged at him like a festering thorn in a sore finger. What was it that was not quite right?Coyote strolled over from his own lodge nearby, nodded to his son-in-law, and sat down. Heads Off could see that the older man's face also wore a look of concern. There was a definite feel of impending trouble in the air. Badger was singing, a tuneless chant reciting deeds of valor. The two men could catch only part of the words."----have met the enemy and killed him----counted many honors----have blooded ourselves anew------."Heads Off saw that across the foreheads of Badger and each of his two companions was a smear of blood. This was a ceremony sometimes employed to mark a young warrior's entry into manhood. A bit of blood from a youth's first buffalo kill was used to mark his face as a symbol of his success.But, these young men had already been initiated into the warrior society. Why, then, the repeat ceremonial announcement?Heads Off looked at the various weapons brandished by young Badger, and at the two unfamiliar horses the young men were leading. Reluctantly, still with the sinking feeling of dread,he was forced to acknowledge the meaning of their repeated blood ritual.The youths had encountered one or two of the Head Splitters and had successfully defeated them. The blooding had been repeated as a sign of the first human kill by these youngsters.The young chief was a bit puzzled as to why this troubled him. He, himself, had killed before. Perhaps he would again, if necessary. If necessary. Perhaps that was the key phrase. Still, there was something else."It is a bad thing, Heads Off." Coyote was speaking. "The young men must not go on private war parties without the consent of the chief and the council."Of course. The young chief was so new to the position of authority that he had overlooked the crux of the problem. To act as these young men had done was to flout his authority.Moreover, such thoughtless actions might easily bring danger to the People. To expose one's own band to the threat of a vengeance raid by the Head Splitters was unthinkable."You will call a council?" Coyote asked in a matter-of-fact tone. Heads Off never ceased to marvel at his father-in-law's ability to suggest and advise without seeming to do so. Of course, a council was the appropriate step. He nodded agreement, just as White Buffalo, the medicine man, strode through the camp toward them. The old man stopped, slightly winded from his brisk walk."You saw?" he demanded."Of course." It was Coyote who answered. "The chief will call a council for tonight to deal with this matter."He motioned for the newcomer to be seated, and the three began to discuss the matter at hand.Copyright ï¿½ 1981 by Don Coldsmith</p><h2>The Queen&#39;s Man: A Medieval Mystery (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>Epiphany, 1193. Eleanor of Aquitaine sits upon England's throne. Her beloved son Richard Lionheart is missing, presumed dead--and the court whispers that her younger son John is plotting to seize the crown.<br><br>Meanwhile, on the snowy highroad from Winchester, a destitute young man falls heir to a blood-stained letter, pressed into his hand by a dying man. The missive becomes Justin de Quincy's passport into the queen's confidence--and into the heart of danger, as he pursues a cunning murderer and jousts with secret traitors in Eleanor's court of intrigue and mystery. . . .</p><p>Do you know the story of Sharon Kay Penman&#39;s first mystery novel, The Sunne in Splendour? She spent every spare moment for years--first as a law student, then as a lawyer--working on the book about Richard III. And when the only copy of the manuscript was stolen from her car, she sat down and wrote it again. Five excellent historical mysteries later, Penman has started a new series set even farther back in time. It&#39;s 1193, and King Richard has disappeared on his way back to England after fighting in the Crusades. Justin de Quincy, the well-educated but illegitimate son of a bishop, is tapped to search for the missing ruler, and he turns out to be just the chap to blow away the cobwebs that often hang over historical mystery.

Urbex (Beauty in Decay, 1)</h2><p>&#34;Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints.&#34; This is the unspoken rule of urban explorers, who sometimes risk their safety, police records, and even their lives to explore abandoned buildings, sewers and storm drains, transit tunnels, utility tunnels, high-security areas of inhabited buildings, and even catacombs such as those in Paris, Rome, Odessa and Naples. Although these urban explorers usually work solo or in small teams, they collectively put forth a ground cry against a modern culture that embraces the new, polished, uniform, and mundane. Urban explorers find the beauty layers of graffiti by years worth of writers, multi-hued peeling paint, antique objects, someone s initials left in the dust on a broken stained glass window and physical manifestations of memory that abandoned, impermanent urban spaces can hold. Beauty in Decay features the best in full-color, panoramic photographs from urban exploration or Urbex around the world.

Because of the speed limit and road conditions, a trip along this road usually takes three hours although some drivers do it in less. They drive serpentine roads, look at quaint houses and magnificent scenery, and depart content that they have driven through a fascinating area. But the High Road is more than just a scenic road trip; it is a journey through the lives of the people, past and present, who-tied to the earth, fiercely independent, and staunchly Catholic-settled a hostile land, created a new life for themselves, and became the moral fiber of New Mexico.
